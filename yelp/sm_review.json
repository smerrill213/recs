It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.",

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.",

Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.\n\nIt was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.\n\nYou can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone.",

The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable.\nLast time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll.  The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter.   I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that.  She nodded agreement.  Then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter.   Odd but also kind of humorous.  I always enjoy being in a David Lynch film from time to time.\nThe service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51.  Be sure to go here instead.   Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s.   take a table.  start a conversations with the truck driver to your left. \nWe used to go to the Pine Cone when it was across the street.  Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street.   That place now sits empty.   Why is this area depressed?   Don't ask me, I don't know.  Do I look like I have all the answers?\nThe food here is good and the prices are cheap.   Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery.  Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods.    Well worth the stop.\nThis place gets four stars because of their five star bakery selection.  Crazy big cinnamon rolls and good prices.",

The Pine Cone has down-home, rib-sticking, greasy food in spades.  The SO and I split the chicken fried steak, which comes with plenty of toast, hashbrowns, and two eggs.  I could'nt finish mine!  The gravy must be the same that they use for biscuits and gravy, because it tasted sausage-y, and as my plate sat there I could see the grease rising to the top.

It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!\nI haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! \n\n My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! \n\nI hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \"one\" star. Maybe they have great breakfast!

You actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating cake batter or cookie dough. You can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish. Yeah it's custard and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut butter chocholate bar to the mix.Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill. Less is more with this stuff let me tell you! Next time I am getting the smallest size, and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega size bucket. Hahaha!",

        "text": "To be fair, I am not yet a customer, so I cannot rate the actual quality of their cable/internet.  That said, I have so no such qualms about revealing their absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service practices.\n\nI spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the \"promotion\" the representative offered me.\n\n-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!\n\n- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!\n\n- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  \"Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the \"Back Button\" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.\"  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!\n\n-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered \"downgrading\" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!\n\n-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!\n\n- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n3 fun filled hours of lies, contradictions, and a misinformation campaign that would dazzle ANY public figure later... absolutely nothing was accomplished, except a gigantic waste of my life and a review that will hopefully reveal these horrifying business practices to all those unsuspecting cable-seeking fellows on Yelp.\n\nBeware.",

Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind. Since I don't trust their billing practices I had no interest in continuing business with them any longer and am now much happier for it!",

There are plenty of other HVAC companies who are more competent and communicative.",

I was pleasantly surprised.  We actually had to cancel our first appointment because we were having some major electrical work done that morning and the power was shut off at the time the appointment was supposed to be.  THEY actually called us a little later in the afternoon to find out how things were going and asked when they could send someone out.  They came out on time and got right to work.  The technician was nice and knowledgeable and explained to me that our A/C was shot (bad compressor and burned out wires- we were worried this might be the case after he said it was almost 20 years old).  I was glad to hear he knew about the warranty process and explained how that would all work too.  \n\nSo far, so good.  I'll be sure to update my review when they actually repair or replace the A/C (it's pending approval from the warranty company at the moment).",

However, there is no designated quiet area that is closed off from the noise/speaking that happens in the front of the library. There is a quiet reading room, but it is not closed off, so the noise easily travels back there. Additionally, there are hardly ANY outlets near tables, so if you need to study using a computer, you're quite possibly out of luck. Overall, I expect a quiet area to study in a library, and this one doesn't necessarily deliver. More outlets would also make it a better studying spot.",

        "text": "The Green Lantern is the kind of place that comes in right above the Mendoza Line.  What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.",

And a good thing too...I had the best breakfast I have eaten in recent memory, and left totally impressed (and full).\n\nBreakfast foods are simple foods.  Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.  I'm docking a star for the corn beef hash--it lacked flavor and that all important crunch.  All the same, I still highly recommend the Lantern for your breakfast needs.",

        "text": "The man and I are on this thing now where we are trying to eat at a few places famous for their fish fry's thanks to an article in Madison Magazine.  There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. \n\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.",

The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.\n\nGreen Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!\n\nI had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!\n\nThe server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)\n\nHint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.\nhint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!

        "text": "Went last Friday to try the famous fish fry.  Arrived at 5:50pm and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait, which I found acceptable.  We were not called until 55 minutes later, and this only happened when I brought my two young sons and sat on the floor conspicuously in plain view of the host stand.  At that point we were offered the \"quick alternative\" of a table downstairs.  Where was this option earlier?\n\nLook, we knew going out on the first Friday of lent would result in a wait and we brought a myriad of distractions along to kill time for our 4 and 2 year olds.  Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.\n\nOur server was very attentive and the food was good.  We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.  We also had baked potatoes and french fries as well as salads.  Overall, this was not the best Madison has to offer.  We may return, but would only due so as a just a couple or as a family if we could arrive before the rush.",

        "text": "We went to the Green Lantern last Friday and it was our first visit there.Several of our friends had always spoken highly of it so we thought we would give their Friday Fish fry a try. I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.",

        "text": "What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.",

I usually get the Cod dinner, which is always cooked perfect, not too soggy or too crispy, which comes with a side AND a soup or salad for only $9.95. I always recommend the Beach House when someone is looking for a GREAT fish fry! :)",

The clientele is awesome and you will always hear some great stories.  But this review is for the food.  ALWAYS AMAZING!  We went for breakfast the other day for the first time in a long time and it was as good as I remember.  The Eggs Benedict are just delicious and something I could eat every day and they make one hell of a Bloody Mary (so I am told by my wife since I do not like them) if your interest in that.\n\nSo if you want some good breakfast on the weekend and in the McFarland area...Breach House it is!",

If that is what you are looking for, you will love it.  There were a bunch of locals there having a good time and if we were there with a group of our friends it might be ok for a few beers.  But still way way too crowded.  Like sardines in a can.\nThere was no one to greet us so we just took a table by the window.   Then we waited and waited.  Then someone came over and said hi.  Then we waited and waited.  I was about to get up and leave when someone came over and said, \"oh, you haven't been waited on yet?\"  So she then tried to help things along.   \nThe menu was average for sandwiches but overpriced, we felt, for entrees as we ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Bluegill.   The Tuna was very good and perhaps appropriately priced but the Bluegill was not proportionately enough.  It was made well enough and had ok flavor but should have been a few dollars less.\nSalad was ok.  At least had a variety of greens but still needed a little more.\nIf I ever went back it would be for a few beers and the view, that's it.\nIt's too bad because we really need some nice places on the lake and with all the lakes around here there aren't as many lakeside restaurants as you would expect.",

        "text": "Now I must state one little thing about the way I rate restaurants. My ratings are relative to my expectations of the experience and in no way relative to other restaurants, (it just isn't fair to use the same scale for a place like the Beach House as you would for The French Laundry so again, it's all relative) \n\nI've only been here for breakfast but the second time I drove a long damn way to have breakfast again so that in and of it self should say something. (another caveat: there are maybe six restaurants in McFarland that don't have drive-thrus)  \n\nI ordered the Walleye and eggs both times along with a bloody mary (gotta love a beer back, yay for Wisconsin). Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that. I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \n\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.",

The restaurant was super easy to find and I loved how it was right on the lake.  I spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern WI on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  We did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived.  We hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  Our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night.  By the time we left, I was very full and satisfied.",

Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. Needless to say, I will not be returning. On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty.",

I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.",

I wanted to celebrate the wife's bday with a quick getaway but didn't want to stay in the usual hotel. so i popped \"lgbt friendly B&Bs\" into google and this place came up. they had a few rooms to choose from but of course the one with the hot tub in the room caught my eye first. i emailed them through the website and the owner Craig got back to me quickly. I reserved the room and then just had to wait until the day arrived. Even though we were arriving earlier than the 3PM check in, Craig was awesome and left a personalized letter and the keys to the house in the mailbox for us to let ourselves in. we put our stuff in the room and when we came downstairs the owners, Craig and Cathy were there and welcomed us to the house, even remembering that we were there for a surprise birthday trip. the house was clean and the room was nicely done. it was definitely more cozy than any hotel room could have ever been, the bed was so comfortable we almost napped thru our dinner reservation! the hot tub was definitely the highlight of the Mentor room, the massage jets were awesome and were so relaxing! in the AM Craig made an awesome breakfast complete with bacon, an egg souffle and a homemade Kringle that was absolutely delish! i couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate my gf's birthday! from the second i made the reservation until the moment we checked out, Craig and Cathy made us feel at home and provided top knotch service to us. If I'm ever in need of a quick getaway to Madison I know exactly where I will stay!!",

Craig is an incredible host, and if you are vegan (which we are not but love the cuisine) he can totally accommodate you.  Funky, eclectic, a nice retreat with caring owners. Not uptight and very kid friendly. Good for a family gathering. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is if you are completely uptight about absolute decorating perfection, then this isn't the place for  you. The hosts make up for this in humor, kindness, and providing a peaceful setting. Good stuff, worth a stay. Mid-week deals are worth looking into.",

        "text": "Goodbye Hotels!  After this cozy little place I'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  \n\nOur host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \n\nThe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \n\nMy fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.  I could't recommend this place enough.",

So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.\n\nThe highlights:\n- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. \n- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.\n- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \n- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. \n\nIf you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.",

It had an attached, good sized bathroom which was great, and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old.  (The water pressure is great by the way).  There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.

Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  From Denise and Justin",

What it is not: posh, uber-modern, sleek, extravagant.\nHas wifi. Has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. Street parking. Does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.\n\nCraig the owner and Coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. \nOur group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty. The weather was nice, so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed Coriander's belly.",

Most likely he was drunk.  \n\nSpartan Bowl, get some better staff.  Perhaps ensure that your staff can stay sober.",

Here's why:\n- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top\n- the sauce is sweet and savory\n- the cheese is rich and delicious\n- the veggies were fresh and tasty\n\nWe ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.\n\nWe also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.\n\nThe service was casual and friendly.\n\nIn regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.\n\nI should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a \"no frills\" kind of place.",

I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). \n\nAnyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. \n\nI gave it a shot and I was impressed! \n\nFirst, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. \n\nThe fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. \n\nThe slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. \n\nTarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. \n\nThe bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. \n\nEverything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.\n\nThe service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.\n\nA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. \n\nIt's worth it though and I'll be back.",

To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates.

Fresh seafood options very limited.\n\nService: Average.  Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty.\n\nValue: Reasonable overall.  Prices fit the portions.

I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.\nAnyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the \"Classic\" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar.\nWe got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce.  Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it).  Mu-shu pork - it was good.  Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it.  Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck.  Very crispy, as in dry.  Not so great.\nThe kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies.  The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative.  Extra help came out when needed.",

        "text": "Imperial Garden has been around a long time and seems to be a local favorite. That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case. The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s. I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now). It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P. F. Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years).",

        "text": "It's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic Chinese food in a place like Madison, particularly after China Palace closed. The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. \n\nMy real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!\n\nIn the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again. I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired.",

        "text": "This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.\n\nWe started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!",

Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us.

Almost taste just like the regular Hot and Sour put of course more of a seafood flavor then pork. It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3. Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it.\n\nThe Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick. Put still good being sweet and garlicky. \n\nThe Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice dish caught me by surprise in a good way. Expecting it would come with that same bland and over salty white sauce. But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce. It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before. The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was \"sizzling\". The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy. Adding a great texture to the dish. The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender. Also in it were pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms.\n\nEven the fortune cookie at the end was a better grade cookie then take-out places.\n\nService was helpful, attentive and friendly.",

I can make it with more flavor. The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong. If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you.

        "text": "I had fond memories of dining at the Imperial Garden... back in the 1990s, when I didn't really have access to more \"exotic\" and interesting foods. I've been to this location twice within the past year or so - once for lunch with a coworker, and once for dinner with friends last night.\n\n+ Huge establishment - impressively big\n+ Quick to be seated\n+ Server was friendly\n+ Waters were refilled quickly\n+ Decent selection of bottled beers/drinks\n\n- Massive menu, but not really... many identical dishes on the menu, with different protein options\n- Food/dishes very salty, but otherwise bland in flavor. No spice, no interesting flavors/tastes\n- Sea bass dish tasted extremely fishy; sea bass should be \"clean\" and non-fishy\n- Duck was very fatty - extremely fatty\n- Red Pepper Chicken (\"very spicy\") had zero flavor and was drowned in pasty brown sauce\n- Service became extremely slow/absent after we received our entrees. Took us 30+ minutes to get checks, pay, and leave - entrees arrived at 7:15pm, we left at 8:15pm.\n\nI'm glad the four of us split entrees last night... I would've been really disappointed had I ordered something for myself. It's just... not very good. Guessing this place caters to folks who want to eat adventurously without really doing so. The food is sub-par; this place is resting on some large laurels.\n\nI'd much prefer a flavorful Thai or Indian dish. Won't be back.",

        "text": "What a crushing experience.\n My son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing. This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.",

It's a prop for the movie to sell the idea of foreign while these two real bad American dudes hash out their differences. It's rich and exotic and mysterious and... goddamn exciting. \n\nIG is a Chinese American restaurant in the burbs of burbs that serves burbanites, but man it had that feeling.\n\nThe Russian friend and I went there on a Sunday night for their Peking Duck special. We got that and some appetizer platter and some wonton soup and some cocktails. None of it was particularly memorable, and in fact the Peking Duck skin was *not* crispy, but the presentation was spot on. There's been so much streamlining of Asian restaurants that nice chairs and big booths with lots of room is uncommon. And on top of it I am a sucker for ethnic restaurants that have good servers that can connect with customers. Do you know how rare that is? Take advantage and talk it out. Be polite and get good service.\n\nI don't think Madison's foodies would give this place four stars. But I saw a bunch of other slant eyes here with me, and I imagined they were like me, wide eyed and happy to be here eating whatever this was.\n\nI'd take my mom here.",

        "text": "Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.",

        "text": "The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.",

I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.\n\nLike I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or \"questionable\".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \n\nWe don't dine in often or at all.  It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That's the way to go here, imho.\n\nTheir location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. \n\nIf you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.  If you don't mind a more formal setting and have the time, go ahead and dine in.",

If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.",

        "text": "After a wonderful day spent sitting down at the Memorial Union, drinking beer and reading through the Sunday newspaper, hunger got the better part of us, and Mexican food sounded yummy.  So, our small group made our way back toward the Middleton and decided to take a short walk over to Mi Cocina.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:00pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated.  The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders.  Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip.\n\nWe quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end.  The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy.  The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available.  There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef.  No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch.\n\nMy dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale.  It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef.\n\nService was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip.  Only complaints?  A tad pricey - our meal was $26 without any beers/margaritas, and there were a ton of kids in there, which was a bit distracting.  All in all a decent experience.",

It's a mouthwatering fajita/taco salad concoction that I\n a. can't get enough of and\n b. can't finish.\n\nI have tried a few other dishes and nothing ranks near the crazy taco.  Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy. I like to add my own anyway.\n\nThey have three versions of guacamole. Yesterday we tried the most basic which was delicious and simple. We also tried an appetizer with cheese and chorizo. It was good, but quickly coagulated which resulted in an undip-able dip.\n\nMARGARITA ALERT- their house margarita... not a traditional margarita. In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.  I'm not your typical margarita drinker.  The aftermath of too much sweet margarita mix and I do not get along.  I admit,  I'm kind of picky about margaritas, but these, these should have a warning when ordering.",

The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.\n\nThe service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.\n\nBut what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!",

I've not been a huge fan of Mi Cocina, so I hoped the new location and fresh look would've improved the experience.\n\nIt's still just barely passable as Mexican food.  Most entrees appear to be drowning in sauces, cheese, and other gooey/greasy stuff.  The salsas are extremely watery and lacking in flavor.  The guacamole (not the tableside-made) is bland and pasty.\n\nI ordered a pollo ensalada (chicken salad), which arrived as a bowl of super watery iceburg lettuce, a slab of seared chicken breast, 4 small slices of cucumber, a spoonful of pico de gallo, and a huge glob of guacamole (which I scraped off and set aside).\n\nThe salad was ok, but as I neared the end, I literally had what looked like a small soup bowl's worth of water resting in the bottom.  \n\nMy coworker's entrees were drenched in various cheese sauces/red sauces; the taco combo was blanketed in cheese.  They loved it, but my guts would've been complaining for days... \n\nSo, enjoy the new location and ambiance - just don't expect better food.

I've had the best salsa here - again very simple, but very delicious - and isn't that what matters? Food should be delicious, especially food at any restaurant.\n\nThe chips - so good, so delicious. Yes, seems so silly to rate the free chips, but again another sign that this restaurant cares about how food tastes and only serves the best of ingredients and food.\n\nAs mentioned above, the abundance of fresh ingredients, especially fresh vegetables, in all dishes.\n\nAs for the other entrees, I've never been disappointed. Take your pick - they're all good.\n\nThis restaurant has actually moved, and is no longer located on University Ave. They are now on Allen Bvld.

Super weird consistency and zero salt. Our second basket was better, but still lacking. The salsa was ok... Not amazing but not bad. Margaritas were good and seemed to be on the strong side which no one should complain about....ever.\n\nMy burrito was actually alright. I had the carnitas burrito and it was good. It needed a bit of spicing up so it asked for hot sauce and another margarita when the waiter checked back. He said no problem. A few min pass and he brings my margarita and says he'll be right bam with the hot sauce. Ok... I'm eating very slowly because I want that hot sauce. It's now been probably 10 min since my margarita came. I don't like eating slow... And I finally say screw it and finish eating. He comes and takes my plate away...

        "text": "On 12/26/11 our 2008 Acura TL broke down in the Wisconsin Dells. We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling.",

There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. \n\nI have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.\n\nP.S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day.  NOBODY does that.

There is also a playground right there which is nice for people that bring their kids along.  The outdoor soccer field looks nice, but they don't have a scoreboard, so you can't tell how much time is left in the game or keep track of the score.  The facility seems well kept, and the staff has been very nice.\n\nIf you have a serious team and are competitive, Keva is a great place to play sports.  If you are looking for something more laid back and social, there are plenty of nice bar leagues around which may be a better fit.",

Two masters, I initially took the one closer to the front door before realizing I'd given the kids the king bed.  Mommy don't play that.  I made everyone switch.  Three tvs.  Two ironing boards and irons.  Kitchenette.\nThe layout and amenities was very much like a Residence Inn but maybe a (small) notch cheaper.\nThe pool/hot tub was really nice.  Indoors, clean and completely empty AND open 24 hours!  Who does that?  It's completely separate from the other buildings, so we didn't feel bad when we were having chicken fights at 11:30 pm our first night (jet lag, ya know).  When we checked in we were told many of the guests were \"transplants\" so we'd most likely have the pool and hot tub to ourselves.  Which made me ask, why would people relocating to the area not want to use the pool?  Doh!  She meant literally transplant PATIENTS at Univ. Hospital or the VA.  I guess I went blond for the weekend...\nOn the map, you'd think there would be major freeway noise as this hotel seriously couldn't get any closer to the beltline.  We heard absolutely nothing.  Either there's good soundproofing or they shut the highway down at midnight.  Also no noise from other rooms.\nDecent standard buffet breakfast.  Sunday paper had no funnies... Did they take 'em out or don't they do that in Wisconsin??\nI would totally stay here again.",

It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\n\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\n\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  \n\nWhenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided.",

        "text": "I can't say enough great things about this location in Middleton.  Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...",

The strength and cardio equipment is modern and always in working condition, and you rarely if ever have to wait for anything. The group fitness options are plentiful and the instructors are engaged and motivating. I don't partake, but there are a ton of yoga, Pilates and Barre offerings in the wellness center across the parking lot from the main facility. The pool areas are clean and well-maintained, and the water in the pools is kept at a comfortable temperature. I've worked out a Harbor for a year now. The club has the appearance of a facility that has expanded multiple times as best it can given the architecture of the building and the space available. It's not easy to navigate as there are many separate rooms, but the staff is friendly and helpful and it's easy enough to figure things out once you get the hang of the layout. I wouldn't mind an update of the facility, but not at the expense of higher prices. It's clean and friendly and doesn't lack options and to me, that's most important.",

Definitely not what you'd expect from a carryout chain pizza place.\n\nThe \"all new\" pizza that the commercials boast about tastes exactly like the \"old\" pizza to me.  Perhaps there's a bit more garlic flavor to the crust, but otherwise seems to be the same 'ole Dominos pie.\n\nPricey, too. A 14\" Brooklyn with 3 toppings and a pair of chocolate lava cakes was $25. Ouch!!! Same deal from Papa Johns would've cost $15.\n\nI usually eat Dominos pizza about once every 2 years. Even with the \"all new\" pizza, I don't think I'll be sampling with any more frequency.\n\nSummary:\n\nService = 5 stars (awesome folks working here, seriously!)\nFood = 2 stars (despite being \"all new\" it still tastes the same to me)\nValue = 1 stars (extremely pricey for take-out pizza)\nMisc = 5 stars (online ordering is the best system ever)",

And this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.\n\nMiddleton is really close to Madison/the UW Campus and convenient to get to.  The store is spacious and well laid-out; really, a photo-fanatic's dream!",

Since all the local independent scrapbook stores in the Madison area are now gone this is really the only option for good scrapbook supplies (apart from the small amounts at places like JoAnn's or Michaels) and they have most things you would need. \n\nRecently, I've been in a few times to use their workroom. It's free of charge Sun - Thu and you can have access to their tools and such. The chairs are very comfortable too. \n\nVery friendly staff, though they sometimes get a bit too chatty and aren't anywhere near the register when you need them. If I could improve Archiver's, it would be to have a more attentive staff in regards to sales and more reasonable prices (for a large chain, they have prices on many things that are higher than small stores - bizarre).",

Several weeks ago I made a very large purchase of many items in order to make a scrapbook for my daughter's bridal shower.  During the course of that shopping experience, an associate kindly offered to keep my selections at the checkout desk while I continued to shop; however, inadvertently another associate also added another customer's purchases to my pile as well, which I did not discover until a few days ago when I proceeded to put together the scrapbook.  When I attempted to return about $20 worth of merchandise that I had paid for but had not selected, I was told I was past their 30-day policy and I was simply out of luck. I later discovered, however, that I had returned these items WITHOUT a receipt, I would have been given a store credit--which I had expressly requested but been denied because I was careful enough to save my receipt!  Nope...no more of my business and I'm telling my story to every woman I know!",

Normally, I'd give most Michaels stores 4stars, but this one tends to be a bit messy and has the wonkiest layout of any craft store. Also, if you pop in and don't find what you're looking for, you have to loop through ALL the checkouts to exit (not just pass by one like at most similar stores). This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable if they happen to not have what I'm looking for or if I just stop in to price something, etc. \n\nOverall, a decent place. Greenway Station on the whole is a bit of a weird shopping center, but I do love that a craft store is in the mix.",

Conversely, Greenway is never over-crowded, parking is easy to find, and during the spring/summer seasons you can get your daily dose of vitamin D while you shop.\n\nThe selection of shops is much smaller, yes, but the Center also houses the higher-end, but still commercial, boutiques that you can't find elsewhere in Madison (e.g. White House Black Market - one of my favorite boutique shops from back home). \n\nSolo shopping at Greenway is definitely one of my favorite ways to spend a sunny Sunday afternoon. :)",

So please take that with a grain of salt.  Otherwise, I appreciate their wide range of stores from little box (like Michael's) to the Loft.

At 7:30 a.m., the assumption in a coffee shop three blocks from a major freeway entrance should probably be that people are on their way to work, or just generally not interested in a leisurely 15-minute wait for a latte!\n\nWhen I entered the store there was one person already waiting for an espresso drink, one person ahead of me and no one behind me. After one of the three employees rung me up, I waited several minutes as the barista VERY leisurely made the person in front of me's cappucino. She was literally pulling an espresso, standing for a few seconds talking to the other girl, then steaming the milk, then standing, and so on.\n\nAfter she finally finished the other guy's drink, she wiped her area down and took her sweet time to start my drink. It was very obvious I was there waiting, and very obvious that she was just wasting time. Meanwhile, her and one of the other employees started to argue with one another, all the while she does nothing. Finally, I tried to make eye contact with one of them, because I really was in a hurry to get back to Milwaukee. Finally, she made my drink, slooooooowly. \n\nAs an aside, I'm not that uptight or fast-paced of a person, but customer service with no customer focus really gets on my nerves, and there is simply no excuse for ignoring a customer in a coffee shop at 7:30 in the morning.

The final draw was when I stood there at the counter for 20min with other customer behind me waiting while I got to listen to. \"You know\" \"Oh my god\" \"She didn't\". \"really, really\" \"Oh my god\" \"He hooked up with who\". The girl working the cash register would look over at me and the others waiting and roll here eyes as she kept on talking with the barista.... When she did take my order she got it wrong. This is basically what I got for service for weeks, so I don't chalk this up to a single rotten apple.",

Parking can be tricky, but they have spots in the front, back and on the street.\nC. Grab a spot near the fireplace in the winter.  Can be a bit breezy in there.\nD. Perhaps get a fortified coffee drink, (as in with some special ingrediants) Daddy Grasshopper, Irish Coffee, etc... they make them up right.\nE. If you have to pass D. there are still plenty of good options for coffee & tea drinkers.\nF. Not as many food options at this location but they do have cookies, scones, bagels, etc..\nG. Plan on getting some good people watching in.  Turns from business crowd, to mama yoga crowd, back to business to the student crowd during the day.  Take your pick.\nH. Hard not to pick up a bottle of booze to take home with you.  Lots of good local options or plenty others.\nI. And if you checked in with Yelp, you'd notice it's 20 % off whole bean coffee. YES\nREPEAT!\nRepeat!\nREPEAT!",

I only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because if i find something better(very unlikely) i won't be able to rate it as such. This buffet has everything you could want from Chinese food. It has a delicious array of chicken's, pork, and seafood. My personal fav's are the Tso's, peppered chicken, crab cheese bake, deep fried shrimp, and the baked salmon. Their crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and soup are fair. Finally their desert. Unlike most Chinese buffets I've been to this one buckets of ice cream. You serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of Mint Chocolate chip, strawberry, butter pecan, and birthday cake. If your ever in the mood to over indulge on food at a really good price. I definitely recommend going here.",

While on a trip to Madison we wandered into this cafe after checking out the local grocery across the street (it's an odd obsession of ours to check out grocery stores when in a new town). When you're starving and pop into the first place you see, you hope for a sandwich with no mold on the bread and a halfway clean glass for your soda. This was light years beyond that.\n\nI had the special salad of the day. It was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese I've had in a very long time. My lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious. \n\nDecor was a tad dark, and since we were there for a late lunch we were the only ones not sitting alone playing with laptops.

        "text": "I had stopped in to the Prairie Cafe & Bakery several times since it opened to buy scones for the office, and I hadn't really given it much thought beyond this purpose.  I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.  Maybe one of these days I'll get a chance to try lunch here too.",

The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be.",

        "text": "A solid little place for breakfast and lunch - my experiences have been good, but not \"outstanding\" - it's pretty difficult to have a bad breakfast (although Perkins seems to have mastered the art of the worst breakfast), so I'm going with 3-stars: A-OK.\n\nThe place gets a little busy on weekends; I've been there both during the week and on weekends.  It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.  I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \n\nMy biggest gripe?  Price.  My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.  That's a little steep for standard breakfast fare...\n\nBreakfast is served all-day long on Saturday and Sunday; during the week it's served until 11am, at which point it's lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, I believe).",

The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!",

        "text": "I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis). The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.",

Can't miss.\n+ Great breads - I've tried nearly all of them and they're excellent\n+ Altera coffee \n+ Friendly staff\n+ Bakery items (cookies/pastries) are superb\n\nCons:\n- Cash only\n- Slightly expensive\n- When busy, seating is hard to come by; small space\n\nNo complaints with the food - it's always been high quality. We were there today as part of a team outing, and several folks commented about the pancakes - they are truly great, with a good sear, excellent flavor, and perfect texture. I had the scramble, and it was as good as always.",

Both days were warm and muggy so I started with an iced coffee. Well done. Can't go wrong with Alterra. For my work lunch I ordered the CBLT, a nicely toasted BLT with a thick cut of bacon and some cheddar melted in. The lettuce and tomato are fresh, as is the \"fresh fruit\" on the side. Today, my wife had an egg sandwich with ham. It was huge, like an omelette on the same toasted bread as my BLT a few days before. The yogurt parfait my daughter ordered had fresh fruit and crunchy granola. The power was out while we were there today, but the staff worked hard to serve everything on the menu. Kudos to them all and to this great little place in Middleton.",

Homefries were kinda greasy, but tasted awesome. Totally looked like they would be gross, but were delicious. Pancake is where it's at. Seriously. Just perfect. \nAlso, I believe they make their own pastries. Several coffee options, too. \nThe outside seating is so cute, too.

        "text": "Pleasant atmosphere, great coffee, hit or miss bakery\n\nWhen I venture to Middleton to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee, I often end up at the Prairie Cafe & Bakery.  It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\n\nThings I like:\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.",

Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards. Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this!",

I assumed I would have to wait a long time for my food and it would be just okay. I was pleasantly surprised. Our food came relatively quickly, and my husband and I both enjoyed our sandwiches.  I had a CBLT which was excellent. The bread was perfect, and I loved fresh ingredients and the special mayo. My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt.  My bean and corn side salad was very fresh tasting, but could have used a tad more flavor. We also had a key lime coconut cookie that was AMAZING. I might have to go back next week just to get another one!!  The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly. My only true \"complaint\" is that it is a bit pricy for what you get - it was almost $30 for our lunch of two sandwiches, two drinks, a cookie and a kid's meal- at least the kid's meal included the drink!  I will definitely be back to the Prairie Cafe! Don't let the other negative reviews scare you away! The sandwiches are definitely worth it! :)",

I had run past Paul's on numerous mornings and always figured the illumated \"Open\" sign was an oversight.\n\nTurns out they really are open at 7am each morning, and that they do indeed serve breakfast, including a prime rib breakfast on Sundays! While I haven't had breakfast from Paul's yet, I can confirm that it smells great!\n\nWe did enjoy a few rounds of drinks while at Paul's last night, and really had a good time.  The establishment is smoke-free (a HUGE bonus in our book), and is laid out in such a manner that the place doesn't feel crowded, even when it's busy.\n\nThe service was top notch; we never waited or wanted for anything, and we enjoyed watching the cook prepare a wide variety of bar fare with impeccible precision and ease. \n\nThe chicken tenders looked amazing, as did the bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Portions were astronomically huge, and the most expensive menu item was $6.75. I can't wait to go there for dinner some night.\n\nWe finished our drinks, paid our tab, thanked the staff and headed home. We were thrilled with Paul's and will definitely be back. We'll update with a report on the food quality as well, but I have a feeling that it won't disappoint.\n\nGo here for: drinks, after work gatherings, breakfast, and to enjoy what appears to be excellent \"bar food\" (burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, etc).",

I fell in love with Chin's when I was living across the street from their downtown location.\n\nI usually go with a selection from the kid's menu, the Smiling Lotus Plate. A battered chicken breast with your choice of sauce (lemon, sweet & sour, and teriyaki - though I'm sure you can pick any sauce, these are just the kid-friendly flavors), choice of rice (white or brown), two cream cheese puffs, a chocolate-coated fortune cookie, and soda or milk, all for $4.17 including tax.\n\nThe SLP is by far the best deal around for my thrifty needs. The adult entrees cost twice as much, and though they offer more meat, they do not include any of the other goodies. One chicken breast is plenty for me. \n\nDespite being inexpensive, the chicken is fairly good quality - I've never had any gross bits (like the weird slimy string you find in chicken tenders at a lot of places). Occasionally the rice is on the dry side, but that's why man invented sauce.\n\nThough 9 times out of 10 I opt for the Smiling Lotus Plate (with lemon sauce & white rice, if you're wondering), occasionally I'll get the Sesame Chicken. Lots of chicken, plenty of rice, two meals easy.",

I knew I was not going to get real Chinese food, I knew I was coming in to get a pseudo version of Americanized Chinese food. My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English. Damn oppressive society.\n\nAnyway, I really should not disparage global initiative the restaurant is embracing. We are all going to be working for Indian companies, as Obama went specifically to India to procure 15 million jobs to alleviate the unemployment crisis in this country. I welcome TATA motors and their cardboard framed cars. I digress.....\n\nRosa, or whatever her name was, with the help of her friend, Miguel (probably not his name, and he was clearly only working there because it was too cold for his primary profession, that being a jockey) managed to screw up my order twice, overcharged me twice and never apologized. Almost thought I was in Los Angeles again.\n\nThe cream cheese puffs were soggy, greasy and about as far from \"puffy\" as one could get. The chicken was white, but it was also fatty and grisly.\nThe Thai spring rolls were not bad flavor but they too were greasy and not very crispy. The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg. Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot. The filling was some processed mash of something, while the outside was supposed to have been lightly pan fried, let's emphasize the word \"lightly.\"\n\nThis is not very good Asian food. I would suggest that there must be a better choice in Madison. I am sure there are Asians in Madison. I have not seen them, but somewhere in this land must lay a pocket of Asians. There is a university, with a math and an engineering department . There has to be Asians somewhere, I would suggest to find them, and ask them where to eat. I am sure Chin's would not be on their list.",

While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. \n\nLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.\n\n**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch.",

I got the stirfry which was okay. I think the crunchy vegetables were the best. The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking. As usual my husband shared with me a piece of his sesame chicken and I instantly got jealous. I wanted his plate.

        "text": "We did takeout from here and both thought our dinners were awesome.  We ordered:\n\n - Chicken wings with Sesame Szechuan sauce (you can get them with any stir fry sauce choice)\n- Hot and sour soup\n- Thai spring rolls\n- Sesame chicken\n- Sweet and sour chicken. \n\nThen we got stuck in rush hour/post blizzard traffic and had a 40 minute commute home.  We were both impressed how well the food held up after that amount of time! The flavor of the wings was good, but they were obviously no longer hot.  Next time we will try those when we dine in.   Everything else had lots of heat and flavor.  The hot and sour soup looked different than any other I have eaten, but it was still good and plenty hot.  I did not detect much sour in it, my only small complaint.  We both felt we had more than enough food for $23, and the quality was great.  We will definitely go back.  I am actually a little shocked at all the bad reviews on this place after our dining experience.  Not sure if they have improved things or we just hit it on a good night.  Service was fast, friendly and accurate...no complaints there.",

The teriyaki chicken and cream puffs are my favorites and even though the chocolate covered fortune cookie was meant for little kids, I still have the balls to ask for one lol. Overall, not a bad choice at all.\n\nOh and I'll say it straight off the bat, this place is not authentic asian food. But for what it is (which is pan asian fast food), it did not disappoint me.",

        "text": "A fast-casual spin-off of a Minnesota-based, fast-food Chinese-American chain that likewise serves nothing special, Chin's gets one star for being the only Asian-American place I know of in Dane County that serves fried cream cheese wontons without crabmeat. I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \n\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \n\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \n\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.",

It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it.

Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh, tasty, generous Chinese. Clean, open kitchen, very fast and large variety. Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE.",

Not only are their staff welcoming and always remember your pup when you come, they also offer doggy daycare!

The staff was busy having conversations behind the counter so service was slow.  The customers were not being attended to.  \n\nI had an event near this place so I went two mornings in a row.  Each morning something catastrophic occurred. Day one, while handing a venti coffee to a patron, the barrista was handing the coffee while securing the lid, which resulted in the coffee tipping over and hitting four people.  While cleaning up, I mentioned that coffee was still under the counter and you would have thought that I told the barrista he was completely inadequate.  I would just hate for someone to lean on the counter and get residual hanging coffee.  \n\nDay two - They ran out of something.  Not sure what.  But something.  I know this because they were all milling around talking crap about someone who was not doing their job.  The funny part is that no one was attending to the people in front of the counter.  Just saying.  The caramel mocha was completely average.  Nothing special.  Definitely glad my event was over but I am sad to see no other competitors in the area but McDonald's.",

        "text": "Time has not been kind to this Cold Stone Creamery location.  For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\n\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)",

My wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  Jacob and Chad told us that they had to reheat the Funnel cake for the sundae twice.  This made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  As we were waiting, I noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  It looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  Tables and floors were dirty and sticky-GROSS.  I did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.

        "text": "At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.",

The other part, I *believe* had a different theme without wood paneling and a linoleum floor with a pool table.  There was a volleyball court outside.  The crowd was a strange mix of middle aged drunks and skanky-dressed younger girls.  \n\nOverall, I have nothing against the bar, and would go back if I was at my friend's house again.",

With its Barn like exterior, and its huge Boar's head are signs of a true Townie bar the town of Middleton can be proud of.  \n\nAs you walk in, the open area for the pool, Foosball, and darts is a nice area separated from the bar allowing proper game play and competition. Also the boar's Juke has a very nice display of music including some of my personal fav's Shinedown, System of a Down, and Hinder. The bar also has an interesting array of  patron's for the true elderly drunks that have been attending this place from their mid 30's to those of the younger ages just looking to throw a few to many back. It allows for many interesting interactions making an evening here very fun!!\n \nAgreed with other reviews the beer selection is limited but they do have a descent array of hard liquors especially my personal favorite WHISKEY!! The prices from my one time stop seemed reasonable and the drinks actually had some liquor in them instead of just soda or water.\n \nI have yet to try any food or enjoy their volleyball courts but would recommend that anyone interested in a townie atmosphere with the possibility of some excitement to give the place a try. I know I look forward to taking some of my friends to this place to get their opinions of what I like to call Middleton's Best Townie Bar!!!",

        "text": "So the Boar, as we affectionately call it. It's good for a lot of things. Darts, pool, Tuesday blues night (live blues band!), fun times, decent beer, waffle fries, and fried cheese curds (if you don't mind the sort that come from the freezer). The food? Not so great. It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.\n\nI think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.\n\nThere isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said. I'll go back because my friends at work like it, but it wouldn't be my top choice. There are definitely other places that can fill my dart needs while providing me with at least decent, non-frozen food.\n\nSorry, Boar - the truth can hurt.",

        "text": "Seriously, I love this place! I wish I could give them ten stars! I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!\n\nAll Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.\n\nThat's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers. Having three rambunctious corgis that get into trouble (catching rabbits and getting worms, swallowing corncobs and needing surgery, attacking car windows and breaking teeth, spraining toes from too much running) means I get to visit more often, and I honestly do not mind at all.",

When we bring our dog to All Pets, she never seems anxious or fearful, as she had occasionally at our old vet's office, which I can only attribute to the genuine love and care the entire staff seems to exhibit towards all the animals that come in. to their clinic.

The race began Friday, so we arrived late Thursday afternoon and left in the morning.\n\nReservations were made months in advance and were honored when we got there. Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies? You just can't.\n\nThe location, strangely enough, was both ideal and not. The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\n\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\n\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life. The area remains relatively quiet and the curtains keep out most of the light.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, so this is a great place to stay if you want to be near Madison but don't need to be right in the city.",

I was working at the University of Wisconsin and chose this place because I like building Marriott points. It's not in Madison at all, so just be aware if you are doing lots of things on campus you got about a 20 minute drive. The good thing is it's pretty close to the road that leads to campus, downtown, and the airport. Downtown Middletown in kinda idyllic too. \n\nI will warn you this is the type of hotel chartered bus passengers like. Cheap, friendly, and next to a Denny's.",

        "text": "The Hody is a pretty solid local bar in Middleton that often has great live music and decent drink specials.  Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time.  There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there.  Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5.  I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  More on that later.  The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\n\nThe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce.  It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems.  I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them.  \n\nThe main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd.  On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  Sundays can be the worst.  I think that some of those people nearly live there.  The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time.",

The underground atmosphere at Louisianne's is quaint yet not unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though I'm sure he would have made a nice dinnertime addition.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping. For an entree, I ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed... though I will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side. I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites.\n\nI was also pleased with the wine selection. And really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!",

It has this cavernous feel(in a good, cozy romantic way--not a dank, moldy creepy way) with nice lighting and just all around nice ambiance. \n\nOur waitress was good, if a bit overzealous...and I loved the fact that she automatically brought me a small carafe of iced tea when she brought my filled glass. Nice. I'm a heavy(tea) drinker, so this was great! I enjoyed my shrimp and corn chowder, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more shrimp(but when is TOO MUCH shrimp ever possible). I also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! Nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary. I wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however. The Cabernet reduction that they came DOUSED in was a bit too rich. I wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce. No matter, I was too full to eat much of it anyhow. My boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite I had was quite tasty). \n\nAlso, I love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30).

The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's.\n\nThe place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.\n\nThe food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.\n\nTheir specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.\n\nThe only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I went here on a whim one night.  I was totally underwhelmed.\n\nFirst of all, the service was REEEEEALLY slow.  from the appetizer on down, everything took forever to arrive.\n\nThe lemon parmesan artichoke hearts were delicious!  the flavors were all perfect.  That was my favorite part of the meal.  My salad was good.  My boyfriend didn't like his soup, so we traded.  The soup was just okay.\n\nI ordered the maple cured duck, and I was surprised at how fatty and tough my duck was.  I really had a hard time eating it because the texture in my mouth made me kind of gag.  the veggies it came with were good, and the flavor of the duck was good.  I'm not normally one to order duck, and I really wished I didn't (I was torn about the coffee chicken.  I normally get chicken, but it seemed like an odd combo of flavors). My boyfriend got the seafood au gratin which was much better.\n\nThe best part was that I was so full on bread by the time my entree arrived that I didn't feel like so much of an ass asking for most of my meal to be put in a doggie bag.  I'd be willing to give this place another chance though.",

I got the lemon artichoke hearts - which were awful, and overpriced. The bread crumbs were drenched in butter and had a greasy feel to them, and the lemon was overpowering. The piano player didn't know any of the songs my friends or I requested - and we weren't making ridiculous requests - what piano player doesn't know Irving Berlin? \n\nIt's a great place to sit and talk and drink wine, AFTER you've eaten somewhere else.",

A co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway.  Good news is, it had dim lightening.  We had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated.  I'm a vegetarian, so I tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak.  We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than I expected.  It had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it.  The entrees were good, I wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and I wish I would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya.  We topped off the meal with the White chocolate mousse  for dessert.  It was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off.\n\nI would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters.  \nThe service was great, our waitress was timely.  She checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave.",

        "text": "All our friends had raved about the food & ambiance, so my wife & I finally decided to try Louisianne's.  The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.",

        "text": "The raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it. Ok. Just had to get that off my chest. The dressing surprised me and I'll go back for more than just that. \n\nWe arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so. I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. There are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  The place is small and intimate. It's the perfect place for a first date. \n\nWe started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful. We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entr\u00e9e and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe special was the highlight of the meal. I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. Then there were scallops. It was one of those dishes that I couldn't comprehend. All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer.",

We sat at the bar and had excellent service by the bartender.  When we first arrived it wasn't very crowded, but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people. The atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music.\n\nWe had the \"combination for 2\" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20.  The mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy bread.  The combination plate was also excellent.  We were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for around $55.  \n\nIt is nice to see a high quality restaurant in Middleton!  We will definitely be back again!",

Not really the type of place you can sit at the bar.  It's very small, there is no television, and hardly any stools. They have live music on the weekends so the place was very loud. My Bartender was the only one behind the bar and the restaurant was pretty busy. So, as you can imagine my service was slow. I had the crab puff pastry and BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer. The Crab Pastry was very good. The BBQ Shrimp however were not. I was surprised they left the shell on the shrimp when they serve it. For my main entree I had the Coffee Crusted Chicken and a half order of jambalaya. They wouldn't let me have jambalaya as a side so I had to order half a plate of it If i wanted to try it. The Chicken was very moist and flavorful.  A lot sweeter than I had anticipated but good. The jambalaya was very disappointing. Overall, I would say it was just ok.",

We waited a very long time to place a drink order, while watching the bartender stand and converse with other patrons. Then, it was an even longer wait to order dinner.  (empty tables all over, so it wasn't due to being busy)  We weren't sure who was supposed to be taking care of us, the bartender or a waitress.   The bartender took our drink order after a long wait, and then after that, finally a waitress came by as asked,  \"I guess you want to hear our specials?\"  She took our order and we never saw her again.  Water came half way through our meal from the bartender.  Our empty plates sat on our table for 25 minutes.  We felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff.  The food is excellent, however, and that just makes it tolerable to go there.  It is not an inexpensive place to eat, and it feels like a place where you should have excellent service.  I got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening.",

They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.\n\nOrder the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka \"Maria's special\". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  \n\nService is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. \n\nIt's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed.",

He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA.  The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.\n\nWe had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...\n\nEach of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.\n\nIn summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!",

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.",

Jambalaya for $20!  Ridiculous really.  A pot of that for 10 people cost $20.   But if you want great atmosphere and good food that is just seasoned well, go.  Drinks are reasonable and service is fantastic.",

We split several desserts and they were delicious as well.

        "text": "My husband and I went to Louisianne's recently after we sold our condo and got a Middleton Chamber of Commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (Leslie Blum, she's great!).\n\nWe wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do. Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.",

        "text": "This is the first Marriott I have ever been a little disappointed in.  I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday.",

I guess that maybe I grew up in an era where the Marriott name meant class and luxury. \nI can't blame Marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the Little Miss (Jon Benet) America contest. The hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West. I couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough. \nIn the future, I would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a Marriott again.",

It's too bad there were so many things that worked against making this a truly awesome hotel: \n\n- The fact that there is no carpet between the pool and the elevators, so the floor is often dangerously wet. \n- The fact that the bathroom door opened onto the toilet - you had to sidestep it in order to close the door. \n- The fact that the night desk clerk, when counting the register, set the cash tray on the counter nearest the customers. It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. I can't imagine it's that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not. \n\nThe only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy. Not even close to being worth the $2800 they sell it for, but fun for a night. \n\nThe room ended up being cheap for the name-brand, but more satisfaction could have been found from a lesser-name place.

Even the smallest things such as hair dryer, ethernet wire, and the ginger orange smell hair products made this stay VERY pleasant. I wanted to bring my work computer up to my room and the front desk gentleman was very helpful in assisting me with all my questions and helping with the cart so i can take it upstairs. When I travel, I dont expect hotel staff to wait on my hand and feet and I am not a needy guest, as long as they are professional and willing to help when i ask for it, I am satisfied with my stay.

        "text": "It's hard to believe this is a Marriott property.  I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.  During a single stay, I have never heard so many staff say, \"I apologize for that\".  Sorry isn't enough, I'll be trying the Hilton Garden Inn next time.  Good service speaks for itself and does not require apologies.",

        "text": "If you've ever wondered what it would be like to attempt to sleep on the infield of the Indy 500, while the race is in progress, and you don't care to spend the money on race tickets, just book a room at this hotel.\nThe property is immediately, I mean immediately adjacent to the infamous \"Beltline\" highway, and the sound attenuating properties of the windows are non-existent. \nI thought the heavy curtains that frame the sheer might help to reduce the mind numbing highway noise.  But guess what, they're decorative only and can't be closed.\nI spent $65/night through Price Line, and that was about $50 too much.\nA few annoyances, in addition to the brain gelatinizing cacophony:\n\n1) What the hell is with the 30 lbs. down duvets that these hotels seem to think add a half star to their rating?  They're excessively hot on all but the coldest nights, they weigh a freaking ton, and when they end up on the floor (as is always my deal) you have nothing left but the thread bare, pallid, dirty sheet. Which isn't enough.\n\n2) Setting the alarm clock requires an advanced degree in electrical engineering.  Seriously, you really expect people to use these pieces of junk? Which leads me to annoyance number 3:\n\n3) When I tried to use the dirty, circa 1981 phone to set my wake up call, and I successively pressed all four of the \"At your service\" buttons I got nothing.  I messed around with the phone for 15 minutes before I finally reached a guy working in the bar (I could never hope to duplicate this feat).  He was kind enough to transfer me to the front desk.\n\n4) I was going to use the in-room coffee maker but it had been filled, at some point, with sour smelling water.  On my worst day of caffiene deprivation, I wouldn't have used that disgusting and antiquated little machine.\n\nA flat screen TV and a weighty down (or down substitute, as it where) duvet do not make a 3.5 star hotel! This place needs a major capital infusion.  Thank you for your time.",

I've been here for three days so far, and i don't think the cafe in the lobby has been vacuumed once, as I've monitored the pile of crumbs underneath the tables and am finding more crumbs (and wrappers and chicken wing bones) each night. My room was dirty (including large stains on the bedskirt and chair) upon arrival, and since I was here for a week for business, I decided not to look around my room too much to save myself from being completely grossed out. Some of the shuttle drivers think they're Indy 500 drivers, swerving around corners so fast that everyone grips the sides of the vehicle. Our driver also asked two people to share one seat in the van, never mind the rules about seatbelts.  Also, if you come in the evening hours and want to eat at the bar, expect to wait no less than 1 hour for your food.",

The rooms and decor a bit dated, but that maybe because it's Wisconsin???\n\nThe rooms are good sized. The King single, had a king bed, a 32\" LCD TV, ipod charging alarm clock, but a really small bathroom. I did have troubles with the heating during my stay here. It took the engineers two days just to get some heat into the room, and they continuously had to check on it while I was out during the day. \n\nThere is a breakfast buffet in the morning (not complimentary) and this is where you can have lunch/dinner or enjoy a drink at the bar. The bar had a good selection of local Wisconsin beers as well as your typical domestics. Bar tenders were super friendly and made the stay a little more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a Marriott Reward member, be sure to have them add your access to the concierge lounge. Here they have free continental breakfast, snacks during the day, and a light meal at night. They have some type of honor system bar too in the evening. Also in the concierge lounge, you can use their computers for Internet browsing.",

I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows.",

Great job to you guys!  This is a business hotel so it's generally empty on the weekends, which is nice.  We had a king room on the 10th (top) floor.  Room was large enough.  Clean.  But, the heater was LOUD.  Squeaky.  So we messed with it... nada.  So we changed rooms, not a big deal.  We went right next door.  That room was the same as the last.  Downsides to this room though, the phone was dirty... I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.  Oh ,also the hot tub was down for maintence when we were there :( Bummer.  But the pool was open and no one was in it.  They also have a stellar gym.  \n\nTo recap:\n\nPROS:\nGreat Staff\nGreat location\nLarge Rooms\nNice TV\nGreat Gym\nHas a pool/hot tub\n\nCONS:\nOutdated Bathroom\nOutdated/Dirty Phones\nOver Startched Bed Linens (both rooms had the same issues)",

        "text": "***This Marriott definitely feels dated and it is not in Downtown Madison; it is a comfortable enough hotel, service is good and room rates are reasonable; however, the hotel has kind of a depressing look and feel to it; it needs an update***\n\nThis Marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel.  Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.",

        "text": "I. Like. This. Hotel. If no shuttle is available to pick you up from the airport, they pay for your cab. The front desk staff is quick and attentive which is exactly what you want after a day of air travel. Room service was very friendly and the food was YUM. The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points? \n\nSo many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem. This Marriott is not as modern as some others, but I'd pick a clean room and good service over some spiffy wallpaper and Berber carpet any day.",

        "text": "I was torn on how to rank this. There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \n\nI get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.",

The staff was really friendly and understanding of hundreds of law grads flooding their venue.  \n\nThe Falling Water restaurant is a convenient locale and located in the lobby.  If I had no vehicle, I would eat there and be okay with it.  I ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was a bit \"buttery.\"  I do like that you can order your food ahead of time and have it ready at a particular time.  \n\nThe rooms are very typical.  Nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  You get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \n\nThe banquet rooms were gorgeous.  The hotel is nicely decorated.  It even has a small waterfall hiding the elevators.  I was annoyed by the parking situation.  It is downhill.  Not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  Perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  The location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.  Forget something at home?  There is even a costco within ten minutes driving.  It is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of Madison (by one highway exit).  \n\nIf you want to stay in Madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.",

        "text": "This review of the Madison Marriott West focuses on the group event services of this facility and not the guest rooms.  I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.",

I have yet to try their bread and chocolates though.\n\nThings I've tried:\nCandied pecan cookie, chocolated-coated mascarpone cookie, morning bun, almond croissant, French cheese braids, chocolate truffle cake, etc. \n\nThe big pluses are the right amount of butter and sugar in their pastries. It is never too sweet or too oily.  The right use of butter also gives a desirable texture as well.  The cakes have very fine layering (4 layers over 2.5in height), which makes the flavors of the cream blends very well with the cakes when you warm it up to room temperature.",

Of course, nothing tasted quite the same as the real European thing, and you are sure to find some pretty standard American bakery there as well.\n\nClasen's doesn't look like too much when you first walk in, but who cares when you have a warehouse of good to gawk at? There are shelves and shelves full of cookies, desserts, breads, sweetbreads, etc! Everything I've tried is quality and very fresh. Be sure to come early for the best selection.\n\nPrices are decent, but the staff can be grumpy.

There were loaves of bread, but the selection is better at Whole Foods or Willy Street Co-op. The cookies had the panache and flair of the garbage that is sold in Starbucks. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar? What is so European about any of this? Greenjim H said about high prices? I am not sure what he bought, I saw nothing that would be classified as high priced. The pastries were as boring as the cookies, danish, morning bun?\n\nI don't know how this classifies as a European bakery. This is an average bakery, in a very far out of the way place.

        "text": "Looks like I'm going to be a dissenting opinion about the Hilton Garden Inn.  I've stayed in Madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that I've stayed at.  Pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  Hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  You know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  There are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, Yelp, etc.  The beds are VERY comfortable.  It shocked me how nice they were.  Bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  Someone had their thinking hat on.  The hotel is walkable to several restaurants & I think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\n\nFor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  It's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  But they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  Whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\n\nI have 2 more trips this year to Madison, and hope I'm staying here again!",

When she couldn't find one she let us have the one in the pantry on the house. That was awesome!\n\nThe rooms were clean, and they have a mini fridge and microwave which is a great plus. The fitness center at this one was impressive. It wasn't an entire gym, but it was bigger than a closet and the machines looked like they were kept very well.

(Thanks Annette!) \n\nThis week I learned that joint compound comes in an easy squirt tube and corner bead makes that nice 90 degree angle where pieces of drywall meet. I also learned that you can't secure anything into corner bead, which is why having a stud finder helps if you're looking to hang a 72\" long roman shade. I also learned that I can easily patch my mistakes with some handy dandy supplies from ACE and although it took a few employees to find \"the patch guy\" he was super informative about exactly what I would need to fix some holes and a chunk of dry wall where my poor shade decided it would rather hang than be secured to my window frame. \n\nOh gravity. \n\nJason H is right, these are some of the nicest people you'll meet with loads of info to help you do it right the second time. \n\nI wouldn't have it any other way.",

Like all the other raters, I think their hash browns are perfect. Their omelettes are not the fluffy kind. They are flat-cooked, sheet-style, folded around all the good stuff you specify. This is the kind of omelette I prefer, and for this style theirs is one of the best I've had. Beyond that, the service is super unpretentious and friendly. Their cinnamon rolls are big, soft, and without the density I favor. Their pancakes are more spongy than I like.

Nothing fancy, good food, large portions.   Others will also enjoy the good food but will be displeased with the lack of space, mismatched dinning wear,  less than average coffee, barely toasted toast and the \"greasy spoon\" environment of the building.   \nSome will see 4 or five stars, go there and say \"dead on.  Loved the place.\"   Others will wonder how someone gave them more than three.\nWe went back and didn't enjoy our food as much as we did the last time and the coffee was not very good.  Also we thought the prices were higher.   \nAnyway, love it or leave it, it is a three star restaurant in our book.",

They have build your own omelets and egg beaters are available by request. Oatmeal was very good. My whole breakfast was $11. One funny thing is that it seemed like they only have six menus for the whole restaurant. We had four in our party and had to wait for a table of six to order before we could get a menu. Overall I liked the simple atmosphere cheap prices and good food.",

        "text": "I was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews.  Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \"dinner\" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty.",

True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.\n\nThat said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  \n\nThe place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.\n\nSet aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is \"cushion\" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.\n\n$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.  Go to Dick & Arnies, appreciate it for what it is, and leave with an excellent haircut.  You won't be disappointed.",

He's a really friendly guy and gives a great haircut, but I'd like to meet Dick at least once.\n\nContrary to the other review posted, my experience has been that you need an appointment any time you want to get a trim. It's not that bad, but there have been times when I've needed to reschedule 2-3 times due to work, and I just feel bad about that. I'm more used to walk-in barber shops, but since this is the only \"real\" barber shop in the area, I'll cope.\n\nThe haircuts I've had so far have been stellar. Ka does a great job every time, and asks all the important questions up front. The first time I went, I didn't realize they didn't take credit cards, and Ka even waited for me to go to the bank and get some cash!\n\nI'd recommend Dick and Arnie's to anyone who likes the \"classic\" barber shop feel, and isn't a fan of \"Cost Cutters\" or \"Sport Clips\", or whatever other chains are out there now. While it doesn't have all the amenities, they give a great haircut.",

Dick & Arnie's Barber Shop (DABS) is always booked solid on Saturdays.\n\nSo, I'm really picky when it comes to haircuts. I like scissor or straight-edge cuts (not trimmer cuts), and I prefer to have a guy cut my hair since (no offense, women!). I've been going to $30-$45 per cut salons in several cities for the last 8 or so years, but when I moved to the Madison area, I was having trouble finding one that seemed like it would satisfy my two requests. Then, I read the Yelp reviews about DABS, especially noticing all the great stuff written about Ka. Since it's only a few quick minutes away from my house, with cuts only costing $16, I figured I'd give it a try, and - WOW! I am a loyal customer.\n\nKa gives fantastic haircuts -- the wife approves EVERY time I come home -- and, especially for the price, this guy just can't be beat. As a person, Ka is considerate and focused (he has a wife and 4 kids in addition to his job at DABS), and it absolutely shows in the haircuts he gives. \n\nLast thing: Lisa, one of the barber/stylists at DABS, decorates the place for almost every holiday throughout the year: St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Fourth of July. Every time I go in, it's festive fun.",

So I tell George I can't wait any longer because I will miss my other appointment.  He tells me we still got time to hang out a little longer.  At 1:50 he finally decides he doesn't have enough time to cut my hair.  You are supposed to be hair cutting professionals.  You should know how long it is going to take to cut someone's hair.  If the person before me showed up late for their appointment why should mine be pushed back? or When I walked in why not tell me hey we are running 30 minutes behind can you wait?  Instead you say nothing absolutely no common courtesy nor do you care that you wasted an hour out of my work day with this.

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.  I'd go back for the fish at lunch, and will definitely be back to sample other foods - the sandwiches looked really good.",

        "text": "Middleton Sport Bowl is kind of a mixed bag.  I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.",

        "text": "Hadn't been to the SportBowl for quite some time, but visited for lunch today, thanks to a hot-tip about the burgers and curds.  Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself.\n\nArrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools.  A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink.  I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu.\n\nTea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please.\n\nThe bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area.\n\nThe food arrived, and it looked spectacular.  Let's start with the curds.\n\nFriends, I know curds.  Believe me.  You can read all you want about the \"awwwesome\" and \"amaaaaaazing\" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck.  Point blank - they suck.  They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland.\n\nWhat \"saves\" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce.  And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, \"Sauce does not a good curd make\" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it).  \n\nThe Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade.  You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried.\n\nAnd the result speaks for itself.  They are EXCELLENT.  So good (see photo).  The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order.  I believe him.  You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County.\n\nThe burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers.  \n\nKnoche's Market supplies the beef.  It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection.  I asked for medium and received a true medium burger.  The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy.  It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home...\n\nThe pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top).\n\nThe bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted.  \n\nThe burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone.  That's saying something.\n\nMiddleton SportBowl = WIN\n\nFood = 4.75 stars\nValue = 4.5 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 3.5 stars (not super inviting environment, but it's a bar/bowling alley)\n\nSummary:\n- Best curds in Madison\n- Top 3 burger in Madison-area\n- Go.",

I'll give them the +1 for appearances.\n\n-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying).\n\n-1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by ...\n\nOverall, 2 stars. I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again.",

This is primarily a burger/fries/curds place; everyone in our party ordered burgers (save for me and my boss - we both ordered salads), and every burger was perfectly cooked and earned rave reviews.\n\nThe salads aren't anything special; processed meats, iceberg lettuce, mediocre veggies.

        "text": "I'm not reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since I don't have the expertise to know what constitutes a good bowling experience.  If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.\n\nThis review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here.",

        "text": "I wanted to like it, I really did. The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!",

        "text": "2-stars may be a bit generous if we're just measuring food quality.  \n\nQuick-n-dirty review: Stamm House features a lot of character, history, and good service.  Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.",

(Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)\n\nSome of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.  \n\nSo we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40's), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it's hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).\n\nSo we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)\n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \"wine cellar\"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \"tour\".  WOW!\n\nIt was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the \"secret\" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.  So, I'm a fan!",

The burgers are really good, the best fast-food burgers in my opinion (yes, better than Culvers, gasp), and the fries are excellent as well.  The best part is that if you get there at any time other than lunchtime, you get fresh fries.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is how they put mayo on some of their burgers, but they never have a problem with making one without mayo.  Service is always friendly, but sometimes a little slow.  Oh yeah, you should also stay away from the chicken strips.  They're bad.\n\nThe decor here is awesome, with wood paneling straight out of the 80's and cheap plastic booths.  There's even a sterile-looking wall clock on one of the walls.  If you want to reminisce about a time before fast-food restaurants tried to be all trendy and hip, you should stop in at Hardee's.",

It is much more pleasing to the eye, but I was still sad when I found out.  Now I go to Perkin's for my old-person decor fix.  Thankfully, the outside of the restaurant still looks like your typical run-down fast food eatery!\n\nAlso, the new fresh-fried chicken strips they've introduced are orders of magnitude better than the old ones, which tasted like they had been fried in a factory, frozen, and then microwaved for five seconds before being served.  Nothing in fast food is ever fresh, but these new chicken strips do a passable impersonation of it.",

Well just the food part. I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later.\"\n\nI was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was.

This place has shelves that is one height and that is it so you can get a grand spectrum of all of the shoes in the store. It is in a great location in Greenway Station in Middleton and it is a very clean and good looking store. The only real qualm I have with the store is that 75% of the store is dedicated to Women's shoes. Which is fine but It would be nice to see a little but bigger selection for Men's shoes.

It's where \"the locals\" go for a burger and cheese curds.  Whether you graduated from MHS in 2004 or in 1969, you'll probably run into someone you know from high school.\n\nI love this place because it hasn't changed a bit - the food is still awesome, they still don't take credit cards, and they still play nothing but football on the big screen tv up front.",

        "text": "Wandered in to the Village Green after a hard day at the office.  Sat at the bar, quizzed the bartender about a few things and ultimately tried a bunch of the \"specialties.\"\n\nService?  Top notch.  The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\n\nSo, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.  I can't wait to try a burger or to enjoy some of their other drink specials.\n\nVillage Green = WIN\n\nFood = 3.75 stars\nService = 5 stars\nValue = 2.75 stars (a bit pricey; $35 for 2 with drinks)\nOverall = 3.75 - 4 stars (atmosphere, service, general vibe, selection = big boost)",

Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. \n\nThe Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green.",

No honey offered with them though.\n\nThe ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. \n\nI can't say that I would visit again. There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.\n\nUPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there. Apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with. I'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate.",

It was very good.   I walked in at 5:06pm, was immediatly greeted and placed my order within a few minutes.        By 5:10pm I had 3 pieces of hot cod, french fries, 2 hush puppies and coleslaw.   The meal was better then expected and exceeded expectations.   The Village Green is a traditional Wisconsin Tavern that has great service.   I am looking forward to next Friday already!   I forgot to mention that they have a decent selection of on tap beer.   I tried the Winter Skull, pretty smooth!",

The burger is juicy and tasty...I add some ketchup and mustard for good measure!  I sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service.  The bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd.  I also ordered a Capital Winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!\n\nI have been in the area for three years and I consistently return to the Village Green as the best burger in the area.  I like the simplicity of the burger and bun.  The meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  Also they have nightly specials and I try to target Tuesday (Sloppy Joes) and Thursday (Road Kill Burrito)...both are great!\n\nQuick, consistent service, very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere; you cannot go wrong.",

You can't take advantage of the specials (like buy one, get one free) unless you're a rewards system member.  I'm not a fan of that... I have about 800-billion rewards programs that I have to keep track of (and that keep track of me); the last thing I need is another rewards program.  I miss the good 'ole days when Walgreens used to offer bargains without the strings.\n\nI think I'm done visiting Walgreens.  It's convenient, but the cons outweigh the pros.",

The guys clothing is fantastic too, although getting your boyfriend to shell out that kind of money to look \"metrosexual\" is sometimes a challenge.

GAP, Banana, and Old Navy used to make affordable and quality clothing, but in the past few years, the prices have increased and the quality has gone to shit.  Clothes I have bought have had their hems fall out after one wearing and their buttons fall off quite easily.  Not only is the quality bad, but the service is horrendous.  Last time I was in the store, a worker said hi to me, but after looking around for a while, never checked in with me, and when I needed a fitting room they were locked and I had to wait almost 10 minutes to get the gals attention to let me in.  \nThe last pair of shoes I bought there were quite comfortable, but within the first 30 minutes of wear, the heel feel off completely.

They are anything but quality.  The clothing in the entire Gap Inc. company has declined in quality over the years.  The service, unforutnatly, has also diminished.  The workers at BR, I find, are unfriendly, unpersonable, and not ever around.  Getting a fitting room in that place is a disaster.  I always have to wait for someone to be done using one, so I get to one that is opened.  Nobody is ever back to there to unlock the doors.  I had a problem once with an associate, or who I thought was an associate, and asked to see the manager.  Well, she was the manager.  Totally unacceptable for a store with such clout.

Even if I wasn't hungry all the time, I'd still say this store blows and here's why. \n\n1. Nobody greets you when you walk in. (Customer Service 101).\n2. You can walk around for 15 minutes with an armful of clothing and nobody will ask you if you need a fitting room. (Customer service 101 & Loss Prevention 101).\n3. Nobody will come by the fitting room to see how you're doing and if you need alternate sizes. (Customer Service 101, Loss Prevention 101 & Sales 101). \n\nI've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before. (Grammar 101). I started as a Gap Inc. employee in 1996 working my way up from Gap Baby to Gap Kids, Gap and finally Banana Republic in 2009. I worked as a sales associate, a visual specialist and most recently men's merchant in Arizona. The three times I've been here the store has always been in disarray which certainly doesn't create for a very stimulating shopping experience and the uninterested staff have made it so I'll simply only shop online now. \n\nSorry BR, you're store's bananas and you've lost me.",

However, I feel that once you find someone they are extremely helpful, at least in my experiences. They are always willing to find you the size you need and haven't taken too long to grab shoes or anything from the back.\n\nI will say over the holiday season they are a bit better but that is to be expected. Finally, It can get a little messy in here when it is busy but again they seem to be understaffed which I feel for. I have actually seen one person consistently working here for about 2 years now and it seems like they never get a day off. So I think it is more a matter of staffing by the store owner or head manager. We'll see what the future brings for them but until then I will continue to shop here!",

        "text": "Maybe I missed something about this place, but after three tries, I just had to stop going back hoping I would finally feel the magic. The burgers are okay, but there are better ones in Madison. \n\nThe last time we were there, my son's chicken sandwich was overcooked, and they charged more money since he got it on a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun. Our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist. The buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them. And the last night we were there, a Friday at about 6:00, the place was full and the service was terrible. As in waiting over fifteen minutes after I had piled all the dirty dishes at the end of the table as a hint that we were way done before the server came by wondering if we wanted anything else. \n\nAnd somehow, with four people, no alcoholic drinks, two appetizers, and four sandwiches, our bill was over $70. That's US dollars. Before the tip. They charge extra for everything - ranch on the side, cheese on a burger - everything. For a really marginal meal and lousy service, that was way too much money.",

They taste good to me because they bring back memories of the 70s.   They do have good flavor but are somewhat messy and there are better burgers than the Gritty.   \nThe bar was more fun when it was small.  We don't go there anymore because often it is so busy that we can't really enjoy the place like we used to.\nBut I would stop by again for the Gritty Burger.\n\nI recently learned that the gritty burger recipe was changed in the 80s sometime?   Correct me if I'm wrong.   We did think the burger was somewhat different from what we remember.  Now we know why.  The old burger that everyone loved was way better than the new one.\nWe think they need to enlarge the place and bring back the original burger if they still have the recipe.   The sauce was the bomb.",

In the past, NG's chicken appeared to be hand-breaded and had a decent dose of pepper in the breading to give it some flavor. Tonight's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips. Flat, factory-breaded, flavorless, and all of them with that gross gooey translucent strip of whatever you get in cheap chicken. Making it worse was the addition of soggy fries and not-as-good-as-I-remembered Gritty sauce. For almost $10, I'm calling this a total bust. Yet another restaurant I can cross off the list for upping price and cutting quality.",

The only time you should really go is if it's your birthday so you can have free beer.\n\nTheir menu is incredibly boring and extremely overpriced for the quality of ingredients that they use. On my most recent visit, our table got an order of Nachos to share. With chicken, it cost $12.50. It was nothing more than a plate of tortilla chips covered in Day-Glo orange cheese, jalapeno slices, and gray (eww) dried out chicken pieces. I also had a burger as my entree, and the beef tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a microwave--almost metallic. My dining partner had a salad that she seemed to enjoy, but it's hard to mess up a simple green salad. Sadly, I've been here more often than I'd like to admit because they host Team Trivia on Tuesday nights. My boyfriend and I decided to start going somewhere else for trivia when we recently won and got a $40 gift certificate and weren't excited to use it because it meant we'd have to try to consume more of their crappy food. We spent it mostly on booze instead.",

Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. \nBut, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. \nWhen our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, \"That's what medium well looks like\" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.\nAs a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.\nStill no drink refills.\nNo one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back.",

As a result of their availability, I was able to find a pair of Ogi drill mounts that fit me wonderfully as well as a pair of polarized Kate Spade sunglasses (non-RX).\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThe optician that assisted me, Ben, has a natural talent for consultative sales. There was absolutely zero pressure involved and he helped me identify two products that genuinely fit my personality, appearance, and lifestyle. I was grateful that he was honest and as a result of his expertise I left with two pairs of eyewear that I can't wear enough.\n\nEYE EXAMS:\nI do not have experience with eye exams provided at Brandon Eyes. I usually purchase from an eyewear boutique in Milwaukee (which is where I live). My prescription from my original Doctor of Optometry was still current, but I wanted to try Brandon Eyes. Needless to say, my prescription was transferred (with no complications) to Brandon Eyes and I was able to buy eyewear.\n\nI suggest visiting Brandon Eyes for any eyewear need and ask for Ben, though I am confident that any of the employees will be able to help.",

I was a soft contact lens wearer and alternated with glasses. Since going to GVSS, I have far less worries including dry or tired eyes from frequent computer use and travel. I also have the freedom of feeling I will never need to wear glasses or travel with them as a back-up ever again. Unexpectedly, the clarity of vision amazes me including night vision.

The cheese curds are good in theory but their deep-fried heavenliness will vanquish your appetite pretty quickly, and then you won't be able to enjoy your greasy, cheesy, mayo-ey burger.  Venturing away from the french fries is generally not a good idea.\n\nThe pork tenderloin sandwich is godlike.  The tenderloin is about twice as big as the bun that it's served on.  I feel like this is my own little secret since I've never seen anybody else ordering or eating it.  Now the cat is out of the bag.\n\nThis place recently did a renovation with a bunch of fake stone veneers and trendy curvy decor all over the place.  Not bad, but I preferred the previous \"nursing home meets McDonalds\" vibe they had going.  They did manage to improve the layout slightly so that the soda dispenser is no longer right in the way of where people are waiting for their to-go orders.  It still gets pretty nuts at lunchtime though, so prepare to drive around the parking lot a few times looking for a place.\n\nOne personal complaint I have with this place is I keep seeing old high school classmates working there.

The food costs twice that of Wend's, Mc D's, Hardys, or Burger King, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease! They figured if you \"butter toast\" the buns you can serve stale bread and know one will know. If you order through the drive through you will be given a number and have to wait. Worst yet if you order a sundae you will get it first while you wait 15-20 minutes for you order to cook. Just in time for you to enjoy you sundae as soup. Worst yet it is not ice cream it is \"custard\". A frank'en food knock off of real ice cream. Oh, and the fry's are soggy. I don't get it. Amongst my friend I'm apparently the only one that doesn't like this place?",

        "text": "As the previous reviewer mentioned, this is a newly remodeled facility which has turned out wonderfully. All new equipment and works great. \n\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.",

        "text": "I bought a Groupon for a half price reflexology pedicure.\n\nThis is an Aveda salon, so if you like their products you at least have that going for you. The salon isn't the easiest to find- it's a plain storefront in a strip mall. Pedicures are done in a small room in back. There are two chairs and they bring a bowl of water for your feet. It's not bad, but it's right by the salon's back room so you can hear employees talking on their breaks. It's not the most well-ventilated room either, so it's a bit warm.\n\nWhat I was expecting was something more than a regular pedicure, since with was supposed to be a \"reflexology\" pedicure. What I got what less that what most basic nail places do- no scrubbing, exfoliation, or even light massage.  They put Aveda lotion on my legs at the end and lightly worked on my nails and cuticles before putting on polish.\n\nThey didn't even use a basecoat or topcoat on my nails, which is really strange for a salon! I would never pay full price for even a regular pedicure here. They have a very small polish selection as well.",

        "text": "For a salon with a name as refreshing as Tangles Salon, this business sure has a its Goldilocks well....tangled. Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\n\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\n\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\n\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\n\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\n\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.",

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     Not A New Client!",

I'd been to the former Tangles locations for pedicures a handful of times and decided to visit their new location when a Living Social coupon was recently offered.  I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).  Next time I'll resist the lure of a good deal and go elsewhere.",

        "text": "I've now eaten twice at Vin Santo.  Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.",

The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment.",

The hostess and waitress were very welcoming.\n\nWe arrived around 7:45 on a Tuesday, and we were the only people in the restaurant, which seemed unusual, but maybe it was because it was a weekday?  Anyway, I ordered the scampi carciofi, which consisted of shrimp, garlic, artichokes, olive oil, and cherry tomatoes served over spinach fettuccine.  The portion was HUGE, and the food was fresh and very tasty.  My colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good.  \n\nI'm not sure Vin Santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect.  I will make sure to come back here whenever I am in the Madison area, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty, delicious Italian meal.",

Despite the wait (45 minutes) the owner (a sweet and thoughtful English woman) made every effort to accommodate us and move us up the list, even asking other patrons if they minded waiting just a couple more minutes.  \n\nAs for the food, none of us could complain about being short-changed...especially the PIC who was carb-loading.  The plates were absolutely delicious and huge (I thoroughly enjoyed the Salsiccia Rossa--pasta with so much homemade Italian sausage that I had to take it home without noodles!).

        "text": "We love Vin Santo and have gone there about every month or two for 3 years. Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\n\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \n\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with. Recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which I hope I am not too full to try someday.",

The two wait staff was attentive, friendly and very professional.  \n  \nWe had a white pizza appetizer, loved the dried tomato pesto.  We each ordered an entree which were all very good.  The  fine sauces, ingredients and preparation was far superior/delicious compared to the usual Italian restaurant!!  Portions were very large so three of us enjoyed them again the next day.

I liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives AND capers made it too salty for my tastes. I had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty. \n\nDEFINITELY get the Tirimasu cake while there. It was wonderful. Not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful. There is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing.",

There is plenty of great Italian in Chicago and this was equal to better than anything I've had in Little Italy.\n\nWe split a couple caesar salads, Salsiccia Rossa, Pollo Tuscana, and Linquini Pecorino.  Everything was incredible fresh and tasty.  Pasta was cooked to a PERFECT al dente on all dishes.  Nothing was oversauced.  The homemade Italian sausage was awesome (wish it was spicier). Honestly some of the best homemade Italian I've ever had.\n\nAmbiance is great, feels like you're in someone's home.  The tables and chairs look like a collection from a garage sale... mean that in a good way.  There'a a really tiny bar upfront that seats 4 people.\n\nDo NOT miss the tiramisu-- simple sensational.  Canoli was good but was my least favorite part of the meal.  Shell was a little too overcooked for me and found the filling to be good but a little gritty.\n\nAll in all easy 4, if not 4.5 stars.

Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them.  We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter.  There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted.",

The portions were generous and the prices reasonable.  The calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious in a rich and spicy tomato/fennel sauce.  The puttanesca sauce was dense with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real treat.  The bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time.  Our water was pleasant and attentive.  The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  but I would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights.",

The front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task. The waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu. Food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time. You can see the chef and the kitchen through the window between the kitchen and the dining room which is always fun.

My wife had the special of giant homemade ravioli with a caramelized onion and portabello mushrooms in a balsamic sauce.  This was really tasty.  The bread pudding is amazing!  Not pretty to look at but delicious!  The coffee is great too!  Would give more stars if they used a little more salt and a few less tables.  I would have also liked to see a few more meat choices.

        "text": "My wife and I ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy to accommodate our dogs.  It had excellent service.  The food was fantastic.  The plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients.  The chef did a wonderful job mixing and balancing flavors.  Even the bar tender nailed the Bellini's. It is very reasonable priced by which I mean a good, long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100.  It is worth it!  If just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60.  This is a great place to dine!",

Downsides - I felt that the dishes could have used more finesse in the seasoning and flavor and less in the overall amount, they were tasty but did not just pop out at me.  For instance, the ravioli was great - good pasta and sauce, but the spinach stuffing was just bland.  Nevertheless, I will go back - need to find out if some of those spicier dishes are truly spicy.",

Salads are also large and fresh. Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks. \n\nFor an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste. \n\nOverall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food. I highly recommend it.",

They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold). I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich. I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup. \n\nThe stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat! The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing. It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!\n\nI'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!",

They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.\n\nThe food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.\n\nThe TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.\n\nThe bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.  After my 4th or 5th trip there (again, because of the volleyball league), they were friendly and joking around with the crew.",

        "text": "A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry.  None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this.",

Even the onion rings were hot and quite tasty.\n\nWait staff is a hoot - they enjoy shaking things up with different songs that all present can enjoy - who doesn't like Muppets doing Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"?? They're all very accommodating with tv channel change requests, please turn up/down the music, etc.\n\nBEST NIGHT TO GO: Badger Band Concert Day in April! The Club gets a bus for Thursday night's concert and you are fed a catered dinner prior to boarding. There's way too much food and it's all really good - don't get me started on the Jambalaya! - whole thing is a great deal.\n\nMy husband and I have enjoyed The Club for years ... and will continue to.",

        "text": "When I go to the Club Tavern, it's a little bit like going home. No, really, I used to live upstairs. I wouldn't call it fine dining, but the food is good. I'm a big fan of the Moose Burger, though I change it up a little bit. It comes with 3 slices of cheese, ham, mushrooms, and bbq sauce, but I have them ditch the mushrooms (i'm allergic) and add bacon and a fried egg, because i LIKE my burgers to give me heart palpitations. Monday night taco nights are pretty awesome, The tacos aren't anything fancy, but they're cheap, and help to offset the copious amounts of tap beer I tend to imbibe. (note: if you drink it straight from the pitcher, it still counts as ONE beer) Club Tavern also offers a pretty good breakfast, and they have specials for the early birds. Best bloody mary in town, (except mine of course, but I live 1000 miles away now...) Happy  hour at the Club was always my favorite. 75 cent pints of Miller High Life. Not the world's greatest beer, but definitely affordable during happy hour. I always like to visit the Club when I get back to town.",

        "text": "Quick review: Family-run breakfast/lunch joint with your typical diner staples.  Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.",

But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better \nthan to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?\n\nSo the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in.\n\nNow, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed. \n\nIt's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare. Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced. It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving. \n\nI had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey. (This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too. Dads got a HUGE complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry, which I thought was nice.   \n\nOh yeah, the eggs with Hollendaise sauce looked and smelled really good...",

Instead, we looked around at our options, and found that C's was highly rated for breakfast, and not too far away. (Best of all, it was about 5 minutes away from our morning destination, I'm Board!)\n\n\nThe first day we came here, we sat outside. (The gramma/farm decor kind of threw me off.) I had the blueberry pancakes with a side of hashbrowns and coffee, and my husband had an omlette with ham, onions, and cheddar & toast. Delicious - I don't know the last time I had such wonderful food when eating out. Even the coffee (and his pepsi!) were great. They hit it out of the park so hard that we decided to come back on Sunday rather than heading downtown to another place for brunch that we found.\n\nSunday's breakfast, my husband had a repeat of Saturday's, and I had one of their specials - a chocolate/banana muffin, eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon.

Typically I would give it a 3-star but some of the service wasn't the greatest and my food was cold...\n\nC's is the kind of family-friendly experience that makes it a 3 to 4 star restaurant on a good day, but on this particular day, our primary server was impatient and lacked a customer-first attitude and the quality of food was lacking. However, the service for a never less then half empty coffee mug, was superb. \n\nI do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better. The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry. The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested.\n\nBut, I was with my family, we were tucked in a cozy corner booth, had great conversation and due to the history of this restaurant and the many times I've been there before, it would be a place I would recommend. I guess the day I was there was just an \"off day\". That happens.",

They are not military friendly at all, they claim to be. We are in TX on orders, they assured us they would renew our lease over and over including several times in September, October, November and December when we inquired about terminating our lease for military orders. We were repeatedly reassured that it would not be an issue to renew in April (while we would still be gone). However, in February, after swindling us for 7 months of extra rent, they informed us they would not be renewing our lease. Fine, their prerogative in the end (although I was BEYOND ticked over this). Now they have been giving \"notices\" to enter our apartment while we're gone even though every single person in their office is full aware that we're in TX and they can't be bothered to send an email to actually make 24 hours notice. \n\nCarla in the front office is great and Mike who heads up maintenance is a saint, but otherwise, the staff here is AWFUL, the walls are thin, the rules are not enforced for quiet time, smoking policy or anything else listed in the lease except when they want to harass you and take advantage. \n\nI would hope that any decent person is able to stay clear of this apartment complex!",

Sure The Bruce Company isn't the cheapest greenhouse in town, but you get what you pay for.,,I'd spend at least $100 on other products trying to kill this weed that was taking over my grass...and had I got over to Bruce's earlier, this $18 bottle of chemical would have cured the mess!  \n\nOutstanding service, expert staff, and they even offer a return policy!

On the wedding gown, the only thing I needed was a bustle put in and that only ended up being one loop so it was very simple. However, she showed me different options and offered her advice and suggestions. The bridesmaid dress needed to be taken in on the sides and again I think she had good advice and offered her thoughts to make it more fitted while still allowing me to move. I think Jackie has good knowledge and does an excellent job, she is personable and she has great prices. I never feel like I am being taken advantage of like at bridal salons that do tailoring. I would definitely recommend Patches and Pieces.\n\nMy only negative about the service is that both times I had to call her to find out when my pieces would be finished. I brought them both in well in advance, so I know she ther more pressing pieces. However, both times I called well after the date she told me they would be done and then she would tell me they would be done by the end of the week (they always were). This was fine for me since they were not rushes and she asked when the events were, so she knew they didn't need to be done right away. It's just something to keep in mind that you may need to call about your pieces if the are taking longer then promised.",

The brewery also has something else inside: lots of really, really good beer.  If you're a fan of the Capitol Brewery, this is a religious pilgrimage.  There's a gift shop and a tour (which should be taken, camera in hand).  Standing in the warehouse surrounded by kegs stacked to the ceiling is a near-religious experience.",

You have to buy one for $3.50 before the tour leaves, or you will be tempted to lick it off the floor during the tour. The tour is about a half-hour, not the most interesting thing I have ever been to, but not bad. Our guide was kind of obnoxious, but grew on us as the time grew on. After the tour, (weather permitting, I assume) you go outside to the beer garden to get your 2oz. mug to start sampling. The guide has to go around and fill up everyone on the tour (~50 people) before you get your beers, so budget an extra hour to sample. \n\nSo in the end, you get 8x 2oz. samples and a tiny beer shot glass for $2.50. Not a bad deal; they just need to make the beers at the bar cheaper so you can leave with a smile on your face.\n\nI believe they do tours on the weekends at 1:30 and 3:30, and they do offer then during weekdays.",

I had never been there before but we stuck around after the tasting and ended up right in the middle of an enormous party!

        "text": "One of my favorite activities of the summer is to hit up the Capital Bier Garten for a relaxing night with my friends and family.  I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.",

Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery.

        "text": "How in the world did I forget/miss a review of the Capital Brewery?  Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.  You won't be disappointed.",

We also got a small drinking glass as part of our tour, and 3 beer bottle caps that can be traded in for a sample of anything on tap.\n\nYou can also trade in all 3 caps for a pint of a single beer, which I wish I had known about before I eagerly sampled my first beer. \n\nAnywaaays, the tour was short and sweet, and the beer cold and refreshing. \n\nA perfect break on a Saturday afternoon.",

With the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. They have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews.

I previously tried some of their beers at the MKE Brewfest and was semi-impressed by the new Imperial IPAs so I wanted to give some of their other beers a try.  I don't know if it's because we came on a day where there was a 5K or what, but the brewery was pretty much closed except for the beer garden and the little store inside.  There were no samples or flights offered and you could only get a pint for like $6 outside.  Bah.  We wanted to try something new so we had an Autumnal Fire and the Appleanche Dopplebock.  We weren't impressed with either one.  Frankly, the Appleanche was just weird.  It smelled like an apple cider and tasted like an average ale.  The Autumnal Fire was decent but nothing special.  I totally committed alcohol abuse and threw half of my beer away.  *GASP* \n\nSadly so, I expected more from Capital and don't think I'd stop back in next time I'm in Madison when there are breweries like Ale Asylum nearby.",

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).",

This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, \"just a second.\" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance.

I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are \"short staffed\" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed. At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that....so I waited....and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted. Waste of my time and money!\n\nI did get a phone number also for what I was told the general manager, called, it was a cell phone with no name on the voicemail, left a message anyway, no return call.\n\nI won't ever be back, and I don't think they even care!",

I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player...\n\n...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why.\n\nEVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait.\n\nIt's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole.\n\nWhy does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food?\n\nFix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return.  Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere.",

Well, I went to get some gyros (they have a mini greek restaurant inside, apparently, called Athens) and saw on the board that they DO have the mac/cheese pizza. I stand corrected. \n\nOn to the gyros. The actual Greek restaurant in town is closed on Mondays, so we came here for our fix. We got gyros only, no fries (there aren't a lot of options, that might be it right there). They come with tomatoes and onions - I requested mine without onions. \n\nThey were fine. Not stellar, not terrible. I've had better ones at a lot of places, but considering that I only had to drive ten minutes to get these, they were good enough. \n\nI was told 15 minutes, and when I got there 15 minutes (or so) later they were ready to go but still warm once I got them home and started devouring.",

All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait.\n\nWe got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog.\n\nVeggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5\" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.\n\nGrilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!\n\nChicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.\n\nIf you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!",

It's obvious that this is a small mom & pop type operation, which is encouraging because this usually means good food.  But we wouldn't know because no one ever came to the counter.  \n\nThere was one couple at a table eating, but no other customers at the time.  There was a dude walking around in the back, he looked right at us, but didn't acknowledge us in any way.  \n\nWe stood there for quite a while and looked over the menu repeatedly, hoping that at any moment someone might come forth and say something as simple as \"I'll be right with you\" etc.  Didn't happen.  \n\nI get the whole idea of them not being fast food, and that good food takes time so on and so forth, but that shouldn't also mean \"we will not acknowledge your presence.  Ever.\"  \n\nThree more people came in behind us and proceeded to wait.  There were then five of us crowding around the counter................waiting...................and waiting...........\n\nHere on Yelp I noticed that one complaint had a response from the business, which gives me some hope, but hey guys, I was there, with money in hand and you dropped the ball.........again apparently.  \n\nWe walked out after waiting a longgggggg time for nothing.   We may try again some day when we have absolutely nothing better to do.  However, if this is standard operating procedure I don't know that they'll still be around for that \"some day.\"",

Considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the $7 and change price was more than reasonable. I'm already looking forward to going back here.

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.\n\nWe arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

You do not get a receipt indicating when they are due back, so if you have five movies and one is due back the next day and the other four in five days, you better be darn sure you know what one, or you will be surprised with a $8-$10 late charge. (And hopefully, the person that hands you the movies tells you the correct one) \nWhen you ask them why they do not print off receipts, they state it is the cost of paper - well, I would think the cost of an angry customer(s) would be more concerning.",

My arms stuck to the new table, the floor was really littered with garbage and my silverware was dirty.  Gross.  It was 2pm on Sat and dead.  No excuse for dirty.\n\nThe waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah.  She was personable and attentive.  She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all.\n\nI ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.\n\nI wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  \n\nSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  \"I'll make you new sandwich,\" said the old lady. I declined.  I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food.  I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.\n\nI bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.  I wonder how many people have done what I did... walk to DQ and had an ice cream cone to try to clean the aftertaste of death and decay from my mouth.  Never again.  I'd go to DQ instead.",

We had no idea what we were missing. When we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly waitress with a thick, possibly Greek accent. Her nametag said her name was Gerestina, but her attitude said she loved her job. The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. And the meal only got better. But the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. The cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other. Through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man. As we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug. It seems that SIR hobos still certainly cares for our fine city's hobo community.",

You can easily sit for more than twenty minutes and not worry about being run out (to make room for more customers).\n\nThe food:\nAny hobo would like this style of dining. Lots of different things, so you will not get tired of eating a lot at once. Also the shear amount will fill you up since a lot of hobos do not eat three meals a day. Again, you are not pressured to finish fast. This makes it much easier to finish the large portions the Hobo has to offer.\n\nThis place would kill a Denny's, without even trying.

Maybe that is true, but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.\n\nI'm not giving it a hard time for \"authenticity\" or any of that eaither.  I love me some good Americanized, crappy Chinese food.  Here, even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible.\n\nI was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet, too.  The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking, the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville, IN.  Seriously, they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm, tasteless piles of mystery?  Gotta be kidding me.\n\nMost options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here, and it was peak dinner eating time.  I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this \"best Chinese\" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYou are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food.",

Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.\n\n\nI resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.\n\nTheir selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\n\n- peanut butter chicken\n- mongolian beef\n- chow mein\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\n- popcorn shrimp\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\n- fish fillets\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\n\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma ...",

My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend.  They've been going there every now and then since they were babies.    \n\nI have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed.  That would be very disappointing.  They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant.   If you have not checked them out give them a try.  If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone.",

I love french toast and all things sugary, and this was definitely sweet. It sort of had a filling (that was the strawberry part). It was delicious, but not for those who claim they don't like sweets. \n\nThe service is terrific, very fast and genuine.

Perhaps my favorite part about my breakfast was the hash brown potatoes. At many places like this, they are soggy and undercooked.  Not only were they spiced well, but they were crispy as well.  That's no joke with breakfast potatoes!    In any case, I've been back twice in a week and a half, and plan on returning often.

Inside looks like a 50s diner with stainless steel lunch counter and cozy booths. Judging by the area around it, it can be that old but at least it looks authentic.  The service was prompt and friendly, even the cook greeted us when we walked in the front door which appears to be the back door as you enter near the back of the kitchen and restrooms. The young cook even said thank you on our way out. I don't think I've ever seen that before, I figured he must be the owner.\n\nThe wife ordered the ultimate omelette, I had the perch lunch. They even had a perch breakfast on the menu that comes with eggs. Only in Wisconsin! The atmosphere and service made you feel right at home. The food was just average.

The people who woked here tried very hard but just didnt seem to know what was going on.  We went in for two 10 peice buckets and it took us more then a half hour to get what we needed..  this is the second time we had been there and the service was terrible both times.",

They said yes, but it resulted in a lot of confusion between employees which drastically slowed service time. The customer complained about the wait, which resulted in an indifferent response from a employee. He said \"if you wanted your order faster you should have called it in\". He said this with an attitude. Then he turned to me and asked if I thought he handled that correctly, and I said no. \nIn the end, being a former employee of this establishment, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service.",

        "text": "The most family oriented work out place in town.  We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there. The taste is okay and price is a little bit on the high end for the amount you get.",

        "text": "I was a member at this club for 5 years.  So I have a lot to say, but not nearly enough Yelp space in which to do it, so I shall do my best to summarize.\n\nPros\n1. Three indoor swimming pools + two jacuzzis\n2. Lots and lots of cardio equipment + 4 different weight areas\n3. Indoor soccer field, track, basketball courts, and racquetball courts\n4. Lots of classes - aerobics, swimming, spinning, etc\n5. Outdoor pools with waterpark\n6. Childcare\n\nCons\n1. Expensive membership with required 2 year contract\n2. You only have access to all the things listed above under the Pros section if you have the Gold Cove membership, which is the most expensive package.  Regardless of having the most expensive membership, you still have to pay extra for most of the classes.  \n3. If you have anything less than the Gold Cove membership, there is one older woman at the front desk, as you check in, who will look at you like you're trying to steal the tanning bed she lives in.  However, there is also a younger one with long, dark hair, who is more of an equal opportunity offender.  She'll treat you like crap, no matter what your status.\n4. If you don't have Gold Cove forget about going to the waterpark, unless you want to pay 23 dollars per person to get in.  \n5. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT bring in any of your own food.  If they catch you anywhere in the facility with so much as a pretzel stick, they will go off on you, thusly informing you that you can only consume food and beverages purchased at THEIR lounge/bar/crappy food place.  Because you know, you might be trying to smuggle in crack cocaine with your pretzels. \n6. Lounge/bar area serves you the crappiest, overpriced food you can find.  I don't know about the bar because I didn't go to a health club to drink.  \n7. Parking is a nightmare, especially in the mornings, and right around the time people are coming home from work.  While that is to be expected, the countless number of SUVs and big pick ups with something to prove, stalking people as they head to their vehicles makes for a dangerously crowded, and highly annoying situation.\n\nThere you have it.  Nice club, with nice amenities, just be prepared to part with your money, and deal with a few annoying aspects.",

Before that I went to the Sun Prairie YMCA and before that the east side Princeton Club (we lived on the east side and then moved to Sun Prairie). \n\nI like this place. The locker room is clean enough, the front desk staff are fast to check me in, and the 'waterpark' part (of which we are very new members) is fine. \n\nI nearly always bring at least one child when I come, and the nursery staff are mostly a great bunch. My older kids are taking part of the summer daycamps, and everyone I've dealt with for that has been great. I've never eaten in the restaurant and so have nothing to add there. \n\nMostly I use the cardio equipment upstairs (they have bikes, ellipticals, and stair climbers, but I'm all about the treadmills). Nearly all the cardio equipment has its own little tv set. \n\nI haven't taken any classes so far, though I'm eyeing the Zumba (pray for me) and the yoga. I'm intimidated by the Spinning classes but may yet grow a spine. They seem to have a lot of different classes. \n\nThey own the hockey place across the street (a new one coming up by the high school) and my understanding is that it will be razed and more parking added. I don't think the parking situation is terrible now, but I try very hard to go during non-peak hours (I am lucky to have a choice most days).",

So allow me to begin again.\n\nThis Walmart location is one of the teeny tiny, original designs.  The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.",

It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why?

Have you ever been to a ghost store?  *Cue the creepy music*\n\nThis super Walmart has all the usual stylings you find at most super Walmarts.  You know what else it has in common with other super Walmarts?  A skeleton crew.  \n\nThere are 4 cashiers,manning the 20 check out lanes, and two customer service peeps behind the counter.  All the other employees are stretched as thin as possible to cover the rest of the store.  I'm in sporting goods, I need a fishing license.  Nope.  You will have to walk all the way back to customer service and request help.  They will then call for help in the sporting goods section over the PA.  Next step:  enter the grumpy, overworked employee.  This is the standard MO for all departments.  If you can't help yourself, you will be going on a hunt for the elusive, poorly treated employee.   \n\nThis is not unusual for Wally world these days.  Many locations run on a skeleton crew, so the bazillionaire Waltons can save a buck.",

Everybody from the old folks home was here tonight.  Most of the time, I love old people, and here is why.  They are old enough now, that they will say what they want and not think twice, you know why?  Cuz they are old, and what are you gonna do?  Take away their walkers?  Take the brake off their wheelchairs?  Hell no you ain't!  \n\nI am drawn to slightly inebriated old ladies and goofy old dudes who spend the evening talking at length about mosquitoes and hip replacements.  Hey look!!  There is a guy over in the corner with all his teeth on the table, and another dude with a dog hidden under the table.  That man over there is pushing an empty wheelchair around in circles!  It's like a geriatric wonderland, and I am Alice!  \n\nThe food here is just ok, but the prices are very cheap, and the service is excellent.  \n\nI wanna be awesome when I'm 90.  *crossing my fingers*",

It has some very kitschy decor (basic small-town breakfast restaurant style) with lots of gingham and wooden chickens, but I didn't care. \n\nNothing on the menu looked very exciting, and it seemed like everything cost a dollar or two more than I would have expected. But the waitress was extremely nice, the coffee was good, and the food (I got the mushroom and cheese omelet) was great. My omelet had three (3!) kinds of cheese and lots of nice 'shrooms inside. It was terrific and also came with hash browns and my choice of toast/pancakes/muffin. I got the rye toast, as always.  \n\nWe got there around 8:30am (on a weekday) and almost had the place to ourselves but more people kept trickling in as we ate.",

Every ice cream item I've ever gotten from here has been great. I had a pumpkin Blizzard in the fall that was DELISH. \n\nIf you are the first car through the drive-through you should count your lucky stars. If you aren't the first then you might have quite a wait (understandable, since the car in front of you might be ordering Peanut Buster Parfaits for the entire marching band and you'd never know until it was too late). A couple of times I've dealt with employees who seemed to hate me and whatever I was ordering (the median age of these people seems to be about 19), but the ice cream was still great . Other times I've had extremely friendly and happy-seeming people at the window/register. Again, yummy ice cream.",

Anyway, I was intrigued by the Blizzard flavor of the month (or, as the sign says, the BLIZZ FLAV): Lemon Meringue. So I buckled the kids in the minivan and headed out. It's summer vacation, so I don't feel bad about having them out after 9pm. It seems like most of Sun Prairie felt the same way, because when we got there we were the sixth car or so in line for the drive-through. \n\nInstead of waiting forever in line with the engine running I parked in the miniscule lot and walked in. I was then second in line behind some squirrely teenage girls. There were three young people working, and they were seriously running their arses off. The young woman who helped the teen in front of me and then me was nothing but professional and courteous. My Blizzards were perfection (Lemon Meringue and Mint Oreo). \n\nI docked a star just because the place is so squished.",

The basis for my low rating is a terrible blizzard that crushed all my blizzard dreams. \n5.

Meanwhile, he called ahead to have someone at the shop prep a loaner car for us to use locally until the shop opened in the morning.\n\nWe called around 8 AM, but they didn't have a report yet, so we called to have a rental car ready. We asked about whether they were open on Sundays, because that was when we would be coming back through. Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.\n\nAt 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes. We cancelled the rental and were on the road by 11 AM. Because of the folks at Prairie Land Towing, we made it to our conference, arriving only a few hours later than we planned, but without missing any major events.\n\nIf you're ever stranded in the Madison, WI area, ask for Prairie Land Towing!",

The salad was soggy from the dressing sitting on it for far too long and then they put on top a hot fresh baked bread stick that came from the freezer, which in turn made the salad hot. I had the sirloin, it was cold, chewy, and bland. My date had the vegetarian pasta, it was over done spinach pasta with some sort of flavorless cream sauce and veggies. Mix in overpriced drinks and you have one of the worst wedding reception venues ever. Stay away!",

I scouted a few locations, with a few places never getting back to me.  We've a large amount of family and friends for this traditional celebration so I needed a place that was both Big (enough for 300+ guests), Bold (that WOW factor when they even entered the building, foyer and ballroom) and Beautiful (for a place that would accentuate my daughter and her Epic Ballgown.)\n\nI sent an email to Lake Windsor with no response.  Two weeks later I called, turns out my email was never received. See?  It pays to follow-up!  My contact from then on was with Ms. Jennifer Larson, the general manager to Lake Windsor Golf and Country Club.  \n\nI need you to understand that this traditional event was very important.  I have been thinking about my daughters 'Coming of Age' party since she was five (5) and I went into the planning stages of this event early in 2009.  Jennifer and I spoke by phone and we met up the following afternoon. She was very informative, knowledgeable, and welcoming. No one had had such an event there at Windsor so she was very excited about this one!  We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!\n\nMy daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.\n\nIf you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s\n\nNo, they are not inexpensive but, you get what you pay for and truly, I'm sure Lake Windsor will take your wishes and concerns seriously and execute them into an unforgettable time as they did with us!",

        "text": "I've been to a wedding here a few years ago.  It was nice, but I don't remember a whole lot about it.  I'm more about the golf.\n\nHow you like this course will likely depend on when you go.  If it's been raining recently, or is a \"wet summer\", you'll find several holes are quite soggy.  Greens, fairways, teeboxes - all areas can be affected.\n\nDuring dry periods, like today (it rained 3 days ago), it wasn't bad and the course was in relatively good shape.  I don't know if it was the sunshine or how the rough was cut (or not cut), but it was really hard to spot a ball in areas where it should be easy.  That was frustrating. \n\nThe course layout is nice with some rolling elevation change (nothing drastic) and water in play on many holes.  A few par 4's will make you think about going around or over water for your second shot - that's always fun!\n\nSo, while not my favorite course in in the area, I will golf here often.  It nice enough and if you look around you can find some good deals.  The staff are always very pleasant and helpful.",

        "text": "Stuck in Lodi for the day, I couldn't find a place for lunch, and I dared not to try \"The Pizza Pit\" in town. I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.",

Had a nice dining area separate from the bar area and was clean an spacious. Our group was rather chatty so it took us a while to order but the waitress was very nice and patient. I got the Southwestern Omelet with pancakes - a little spicy but good. Others in our group got the french toast and one got prime rib and eggs. All were happy.

It came with a soup or salad and was more than enough food. \n\nOthers in our party had a fish sandwich, tortilla encrusted tilapia, burito, pork roast and a couple of salads.

I found them to be extremely reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you are given.\n\nBeers/wine also seems to be reasonable.  I had a glass of pinot grigio and it was only $4.95.\n\nI was extremely impressed with the service.

We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  \n\nWhen I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and awesome name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself.",

Made to order deli-sandwiches, cheese, fudge, a New Glarus beverage and Southern Comfort? Yes, Southern Comfort. True one stop shopping. I will make this a regular stop between Elgin and Minnesota!",
